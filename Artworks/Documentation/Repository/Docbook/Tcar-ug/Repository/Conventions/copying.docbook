        &TCP; uses &TCAR; to produce &TCP; corporate visual identity.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        The &TCAR; is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and
        there are restrictions on their distribution, but these
        restrictions are designed to permit everything that a good
        cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is
        to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of
        this work that they might get from you.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to
        give away copies of &TCAR;, that you receive source code or
        else can get it if you want it, that you can change this work
        or use pieces of it in new free works, and that you know you
        can do these things.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid
        you to deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if
        you distribute copies of the &TCAR;, you must give the
        recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure
        that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
        must tell them their rights.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that
        everyone finds out that there is no warranty for the &TCAR;.
        If this work is modified by someone else and passed on, we
        want their recipients to know that what they have is not what
        we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will
        not reflect on our reputation.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        The &TCAR; is released as a GPL work.  Individual packages
        used by &TCAR; include their own licenses and the &TCAR;
        license applies to all packages that it does not clash with.
        If there is a clash between the &TCAR; license and individual
        package licenses, the individual package license applies
        instead.

        in <xref linkend="licenses-gpl" />. This manual specifically
        is covered by the conditions found in <xref
        linkend="licenses-gfdl" />.
