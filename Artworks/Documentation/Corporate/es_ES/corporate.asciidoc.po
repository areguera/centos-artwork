"three visual manifestions: The CentOS Distribution, The CentOS Web and The "
"CentOS Showroom. Inside The CentOS Distribution visual manifestations, The "
"CentOS Project maintains near to four different major releases of The CentOS "
"Distribution, parallely in time. However, inside The CentOS Web visual "
"manifestations, the content is produced for no specific release information "
"(e.g., there is no a complete web site for each major release of The CentOS "
"Distribution individually, but one web site to cover them all). Likewise, "
"the content produced in The CentOS Showroom is industrially created for no "

"In order to produce the The CentOS Project Monolithic Corporate Visual "
"Identity Structure correctly, we need to concider all the visual "

"Distribution, which one of those different visual styles would be used to "
"cover the remaining visual manifestations The CentOS Project is made of (e."
"g., The CentOS Web and The CentOS Showroom)?"

msgid ""
"Probably you are thinking: yes, I see your point, but The CentOS Brand "
"connects them all already, why would we need to join them up into the same "
"visual style too, isn't it more work to do, and harder to maintain?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Harder to maintain, more work to do, probably. Specially when you consider "
"that The CentOS Project has proven stability and consistency through time "
"and, that, certainly, didn't come through swinging magical wands or "
"something but hardly working out to automate tasks and providing maintenance "
"through time. With that in mind, I consider The CentOS Project Corporate "
"Visual Identity Structure must be consequent with such stability and "
"consistency tradition. It is true that The CentOS Brand does connect all the "
"visual manifestations it is present on, but that connection is strengthened "
"if one unique visual style backups it. In fact, whatever thing you do to "
"strength the visual connection among The CentOS Project visual "
"manifestations would be very good in favor of The CentOS Project recognition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Obviously, having just one visual style in all visual manifestations for "
"eternity would be a very boring thing and would give the idea of a visually "
"outdated project. So, there is no problem on creating new visual styles for "
"each new major release of The CentOS Distribution, in order to refresh The "
"CentOS Distribution visual style; the problem itself is in not propagating "
"the new visual style created for the new release of The CentOS Distribution "
"to all other visual manifestations The CentOS Project is made of, in a way "
"The CentOS Project could be recognized no matter what visual manifestation "
"be in front of us. Such lack of uniformity is what introduces the visual "
"contradiction we would be precisely trying to solve by mean of themes "
"production in The CentOS Artwork Repository."
