             standards.  However, if your prefix contains only ASCII

             disable prefix encoding.  This can make the subject headers

             properly handle non-ASCII encodings.</p>

             <p>Note however, that if your mailing list receives both encoded
             and unencoded subject headers, you might want to choose <em>As
             needed</em>.  Using this setting, Mailman will not encode ASCII
             prefixes when the rest of the header contains only ASCII
             characters, but if the original header contains non-ASCII
             characters, it will encode the prefix.  This avoids an ambiguity
             in the standards which could cause some mail readers to display
             extra, or missing spaces between the prefix and the original
             header.""")),
