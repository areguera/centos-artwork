      read this page it means that the Apache HTTP server installed

        <p>If you would like to let the administrators of this

      <h2>About CentOS:</h2>

      <p><strong>The Community ENTerprise Operating System</strong>
      (CentOS) is an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from
      sources freely provided to the public by a prominent North
      American Enterprise Linux vendor. CentOS conforms fully with the
      upstream vendors redistribution policy and aims to be 100%
      binary compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove
      upstream vendor branding and artwork.) The CentOS Project is the
      organization that builds CentOS.</p>

      <p>For information on CentOS please visit the <a href=
      "http://www.centos.org/">CentOS website</a>.</p>

                <p>CentOS is an Operating System and it is used to
                power this website; however, the webserver is owned by
                the domain owner and not the CentOS Project.
                <strong>If you have issues with the content of this
                site, contact the owner of the domain, not the CentOS
                project.</strong></p>

                <p>Unless this server is on the CentOS.org domain,
                the CentOS Project doesn't have anything to do with
                the content on this webserver or any e-mails that
                directed you to this site.</p>

                <p>For example, if this website is www.example.com,
                you would find the owner of the example.com domain
