"end up refering the same files inside our working copies through "
"different absolute paths. This generates a contradiction when "
"files, holding path information inside, are committed up to the "
"central repository. The contradiction comes from the question: "
"which is the correct absolute path to use inside such files, yours "
"or mine? — No one of them is, of course."

msgid "Case 2: One unique home directory"

"</filename>) to store the working copy of <ulink type=\"https\" url="
"\"https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork\">The CentOS Artwork "
"Repository</ulink> in our own workstations, but configure the "
"subversion client to use different user names to commit changes up "
"from the working copy to the central repository. This configuration "
"might be not so good for situations where you and I have to share "
"the same workstation. In such case, it would be required that we "
"both share the password information of the same system user (the "
"<emphasis>centos</emphasis> user in our example) which, in "
"addition, gives access to that user's subversion client "
"configuration and this way provokes the whole sense of using "
"different subversion credentials for committing changes to be lost."
msgstr ""

msgid "Case 3: Different home directories through dynamic expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of the absolute paths we use inside the working copy are made "
"of two parts, one dynamic and one fixed. The dynamic part is the "
"home directory of the current user and its value can be retrived "
"from the <envar>$HOME</envar> environment variable. The fixed part "
"of the path is the one we set inside the repositroy structure "
"itself as organization matter. What we need here is to find a way "
"to expand variables inside files that don't support variable "
"expansion. So far we've been doing this through creation template "
"instances which are temporal files with translation markers "
"expanded inside. This work rather fine with template files that are "
"one-time-pass (e.g., when we produce produce PNG files from SVG "
"files and XTHML from DocBook files), but the same is not true for "
"absolute paths inside files that are used as in their permanent "
"state inside the repository (e.g., CSS files and other files "
"similar in purpose)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the three cases discussed above, the second one (i.e., One "
"unique home directory) seems to be the best candidate. It limits us "
"from using more than one working copy in the same workstation, but "
"gives us the chance of standardizing the use of absolute paths "
"inside all the working copies of <ulink type=\"https\" url="
"\"https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork\">The CentOS Artwork "
"Repository</ulink>. Using absolute paths is very convenient because "
"it is possible to reuse information from different locations inside "
"the working copy, something that would be almost imposible to "
"maintain if relative paths were used instead. Thus, lets assume the "
"second case of handling home directories as default solution to "
"relatively solve the problem of where to store working copies of "
"<ulink type=\"https\" url=\"https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork"
