"The CentOS Artwork Repository started during a discussion about how to "
"automate the slide images of Anaconda, at CentOS Developers mailing list "
"(<ulink url=\"mailto:centos-devel@centos.org\">centos-devel@centos.org</"
"ulink>) around 2008. In such discussion, Ralph Angenendt rose up his hand to "
"ask —Do you have something to show?—."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To answer the question, Alain Reguera Delgado suggested a bash script which "
"combined SVG and SED files in order to produce PNG images in different "
"languages —in conjunction with the proposition of creating a Subversion "
"repository where translations and image production could be distributed "
"inside The CentOS Community—."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Karanbirn Sighn considered the idea intresting and provided the "

"Once the CentOS Artwork Repository was available, Alain Reguera Delgado "

msgid ""
"Around 2009, the rendition script was at a very rustic state where only "
"slide images could be produced, so it was redesigned to extend the image "
"production to other areas, different from slide images. In this "
"configuration, one SVG file was used as input to produce a translated "
"instance of it which, in turn, was used to produce one translated PNG image "
"as output. The SVG translated instance was created through SED replacement "
"commands. The translated PNG image was created from the SVG translated "
"instance using Inkscape command-line interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The repository directory structure was prepared to receive the rendition "
"script using design templates and translation files in the same location. "
"There was one directory structure for each artwork that needed to be "
"produced. In this configuration, if you would want to produce the same "
"artwork with a different visual style or structure, it was needed to create "
"a new directory structure for it because both the image structure and the "
"image visual style were together in the design template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rendition script was moved to a common place and linked from different "
"directory structures. There was no need to have the same code in different "
"directory structures if it could be in just one place and then be linked "

"Project</emphasis>."
msgstr ""

"Around 2010, the rendition script changed its name from <command>render.sh</"

"functionalities where rendition was just one among others (e.g., "
"documentation and localization)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <command>centos-art.sh</command> was initially conceived to automate "
"frequent tasks inside the repository based in the idea of Unix toolbox: to "
"create small and specialized tools that do one thing well. This way, "
"functionalities inside <command>centos-art.sh</command> began to be "
"identified and separated one another. For example, when images were "
"rendered, there was no need to load functionalities related to documentation "
"manual. This layout moved us onto <quote>common functionalities</quote> and "
"<quote>specific functionalities</quote> inside <command>centos-art.sh</"
"command> script. Common functionalities are loaded when <command>centos-art."
"sh</command> script is initiated and are available to specific "
"functionalities."

msgid ""
"Suddenly, no need was found to keep all the links spreaded around the "
"repository in order to execute the <command>centos-art.sh</command> script "
"from different locations. The centos-art command-line interface was used "
"instead. The centos-art command-line interface is a symbolic link stored "
"inside the <filename class=\"directory\">~/bin</filename> directory that "
"point to <command>centos-art.sh</command> script. As default configuration, "
"inside The CentOS Distribution, the path to <filename class=\"directory\">~/"
"bin</filename> is included in the search path for commands (see PATH "

"The repository directory structure was updated to improve the implementation "

"divided out to separate directory structures: the design models and artistic "
"motifs directory structures. From this point on, the <command>centos-art.sh</"

"In the documentation area, the documents in LaTeX format were migrated to "

"In the documentation area, support for producing localized transformations "

"Producing documentation through DocBook XML as default documentation backend "

"This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that "

"A <quote>Secondary Section</quote> is a named appendix or a front-matter "

"to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within "
"that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of "
"mathematics, a <xref linkend=\"secondary-section\"/> may not explain any "

"The <quote>Invariant Sections</quote> are certain <xref linkend=\"secondary-"
