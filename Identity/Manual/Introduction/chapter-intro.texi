Welcome to CentOS Artwork Repository Manual.

The CentOS Artwork Repository Manual describes how The CentOS Project
Corporate Visual Identity is organized and produced inside the CentOS
Artwork Repository (@url{https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork/}).
If you are looking for a comprehensive, task-oriented guide for
understanding how The CentOS Project Corporate Visual Identity is
produced, this is the manual for you.

This manual discusses the following intermedite topics: 

@itemize
@item The CentOS Brand
@item The CentOS Corporate Visual Structure
@item The CentOS Corporate Visual Style
@end itemize

This manual is organized in the same way of CentOS Artwork Repository
directory structure. In the CentOS Artwork Repository we use
directories to store conceptual ideas of The CentOS Project Corporate
Visual Identity.  For this manual sake, each directory in CentOS
Artwork Repository has its own documentation section to describe the
related conceptual ideas it is based on.

This manual uses Texinfo as base documentation system. The Texinfo
documentation structure is controlled by the @code{help} functionality
of @command{centos-art.sh} script. Through this functionality you can
create documentation sections for each directory structure inside the
repository and edit those already created, as well. @xref{Directories
trunk Scripts Functions Help}, for more information on how to use the
@command{help} functionality of @command{centos-art.sh} script.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of your CentOS
system. If you need help with CentOS, refer to the help page on the
CentOS Wiki (@url{http://wiki.centos.org/Help}) for a list of
different places you can find help.
