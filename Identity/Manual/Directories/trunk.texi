@subsection Goals

This directory implements the Subversion's trunk concept in a
trunk, branches, tags repository structure.

@subsection Description

The @file{trunk/} directory structure is the main development line
inside the CentOS Artwork Repository and organizes the following
sections:

@table @strong
@item Identity

This section describes the implementation of The CentOS Project
Corporate Identity. This place is perfect to consolidate @emph{The
CentOS Artwork SIG}. If you are interested in producing art works for
The CentOS Project, this place is for you. 

@xref{Directories trunk Identity}, for more information.

@item Scripts

This section describes the implementation of @command{centos-art.sh}
script, a bash scripts specially designed to automate most frequent
tasks in the repository (e.g., image rendition, documenting directory
structures, translating content, etc.).  If you can't resist the idea
of automating repeatable tasks, then take a look here.

@xref{Directories trunk Scripts}, for more information.

@subsection Usage

It seems to be no other use for this directory but to organize the
sections described above.
