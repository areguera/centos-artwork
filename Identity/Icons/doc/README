						      SHARED DIRECTORY

**********************************************************************

    The `Shared' directory is use to store common images that are
    shared among different sections of the artwork environment.

    In order to build some images, like those in anaconda slides
    section, it is needed to have some images already rendered in a
    proper dimension so they could be included before the final
    rendering of the image, the anaconda slide in this case.

    These kind of images are organized here in the shared directory.
    Generally the content of this directory are icons and graphical
    representations of actions, applications, mime-types and so on.

    Event default dimensions of these images may vary, it is
    recommend to use an standard dimension for svg templates designs
    (ex.  width=150px) and then vary the size of final rendered image
    through the ./rendere.sh script. The syntax is as following:

    	./render.sh filename dimension

    These images are rendered inside img directory. img directory is
    organized in subdirectories with a number as name, that number is
    equivalent to images' width inside it. Those are the
    subdirectories used by different artwork sections to retrive the
    needed image for its own purpose.
