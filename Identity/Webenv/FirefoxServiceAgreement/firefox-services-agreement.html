    <h1>Mozilla Firefox Website Services Agreement</h1>

    <h2>Version 3.0, June 2008</h2>

    <p>During the Mozilla Firefox installation process, and at later
times, you may be given the option of installing additional components
from third-party software providers. The installation and use of those
third-party components may be governed by additional license
agreements.</p>

    <p>In this Mozilla Firefox Website Services Agreement
("Agreement"), the accompanying executable version of Mozilla Firefox
shall be referred to as "the Product".</p>

    <p>The Product utilizes website information services ("Services"),
such as safe-browsing features, which are provided by the Mozilla
Corporation ("Mozilla") and made available to you subject to the terms
below. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this
Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not
use the Services and disable the Services in the preferences/security
menu. </p>

<p><strong>1. USE OF SERVICES.</strong> Mozilla permits you to use the
Services via the Product. This Agreement will also govern the use of
Services made available to you as a result of your installing any
executable software upgrades to the Product provided to you by CentOS,
where those Services replace and/or supplement the Services provided
through use of the Product. In such a case, "the Product" shall also
refer to such installed upgrades. However, if such upgrades are
accompanied by a separate agreement from Mozilla, the terms of that
agreement will govern.</p>

<p><strong>2. TERMINATION.</strong> If you breach this Agreement your
right to use the Services will terminate immediately and without
notice, but all provisions of this Agreement except the Use of
Services (Paragraph 1) will survive termination and continue in
effect. </p>

<p><strong>3. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.</strong> Subject to this Agreement
and to all applicable licensing terms governing your use of the
Product, Mozilla, for itself and on behalf of its licensors, hereby
reserves all intellectual property rights in the Services, except for
the rights expressly granted in this Agreement. You may not remove or
alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notice in or
on the Product. This agreement does not grant you any right to use the
trademarks, service marks or logos of Mozilla or its licensors.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit any rights
granted under open source licenses applicable to the Product and to
corresponding source code versions of the Product. </p>

<p><strong>4. PRIVACY POLICY.</strong> The Mozilla Firefox Privacy
Policy is made available online at <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/legal/privacy/">http://www.mozilla.com/legal/privacy/</a>,
as that policy may be updated from time to time. </p>

<p><strong>5. WEBSITE INFORMATION SERVICES.</strong> Mozilla and its
contributors, licensors and partners work to provide the most accurate
and up-to-date phishing and malware information. However, they cannot
guarantee that this information is comprehensive and error-free: some
risky sites may not be identified, and some safe sites may be
identified in error. </p>

<p><strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</strong> THE PRODUCT AND
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, MOZILLA AND MOZILLA'S DISTRIBUTORS, AND LICENSORS HEREBY
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT AND SERVICES ARE FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE PRODUCT
AND SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE PRODUCT AND SERVICES. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p><strong>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY
LAW, MOZILLA AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS, DIRECTORS, LICENSORS, CONTRIBUTORS
AND AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "MOZILLA GROUP") WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT AND THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS,
LOSS OF DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY
(CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE
MOZILLA GROUP'S COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT
EXCEED THE GREATER OF $500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS) AND THE FEES PAID BY
YOU UNDER THE LICENSE (IF ANY). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p><strong>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END-USERS.</strong> This Product is a
"commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101,
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
(Sept. 1995) and 48 C.F.R.  227.7202 (June 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212, 48 C.F.R.  27.405(b)(2) (June 1998) and 48 C.F.R.
227.7202, all U.S. Government End Users acquire the Product with only
those rights as set forth therein. </p>

<p><strong>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</strong> (a) This Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement between Mozilla and you concerning the subject
matter hereof, and it may only be modified by a written amendment
signed by an authorized executive of Mozilla. (b) Except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement will be
governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its
conflict of law provisions. (c) This Agreement will not be governed by
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods.  (d) If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties'
original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force
and effect. (e) A waiver by either party of any term or condition of
this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not
waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. (f)
Except as required by law, the controlling language of this Agreement
is English. (g) You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any
party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms; the
Mozilla Corporation may assign its rights under this Agreement without
condition. (h) This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
