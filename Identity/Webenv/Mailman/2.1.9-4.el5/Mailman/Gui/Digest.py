##                 the mail server.

##                 <p>However, some lists can benefit from a more personalized
##                 approach.  In this case, Mailman crafts a new message for

##                 a whole.

##                 <p>You need to carefully consider whether the trade-off is
##                 worth it, or whether there are other ways to accomplish what
##                 you want.  You should also carefully monitor your system load
##                 to make sure it is acceptable.

##                 <p>These additional substitution variables will be available
##                 for your headers and footers, when this feature is enabled:
