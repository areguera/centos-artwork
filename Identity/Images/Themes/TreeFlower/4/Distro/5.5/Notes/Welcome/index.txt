Welcome

   Welcome to CentOS, the Community Enterprise Operating System.

What is CentOS?

   CentOS is an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from
   sources  freely  provided to the public by a prominent North
   American Enterprise Linux vendor. CentOS conforms fully with the
   upstream vendors redistribution policy and aims to be 100% binary
   compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream
   vendor branding and artwork.)

   CentOS  is  developed  by  a  small but growing team of core
   developers. In turn the core developers are supported by an active
   user  community  including  system  administrators,  network
   administrators,   enterprise  users,  managers,  core  Linux
   contributors and Linux enthusiasts from around the world.

Advantages

   CentOS has numerous advantages including: an active and growing
   user  community,  quickly  rebuilt, tested, and QA'ed errata
   packages,  an  extensive  mirror network, developers who are

   distribution, multiple free support avenues.
