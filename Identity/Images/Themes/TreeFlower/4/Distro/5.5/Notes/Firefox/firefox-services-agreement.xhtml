                <h3>Warning</h3>
                <p>The accompanying version of Mozilla Firefox
                utilizes website information services ("Services"),
                such as safe-browsing features, which are provided by
                the Mozilla Corporation and made available to you
                under additional terms. By using the Services, you
                consent to the terms of the referenced Mozilla Firefox
                <a href="#firefox-services-agreement">Website Services
                Agreement</a>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <a name="firefox-services-agreement"></a>

            <h1>Mozilla Firefox Website Services Agreement</h1>

            <p>If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the
            Services and disable the Services in <tt>Edit >
            Preferences > Security</tt> and uncheck the options for
            both: "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected
            attack site" and "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a
            suspected forgery".</p>

            <h2>Version 3.0, June 2008</h2>

            <p>During the Mozilla Firefox installation process, and at
            later times, you may be given the option of installing
            additional components from third-party software providers.
            The installation and use of those third-party components
            may be governed by additional license agreements.</p>

            <p>In this Mozilla Firefox Website Services Agreement
            ("Agreement"), the accompanying executable version of
            Mozilla Firefox shall be referred to as "the Product".</p>

            <p>The Product utilizes website information services
            ("Services"), such as safe-browsing features, which are
            provided by the Mozilla Corporation ("Mozilla") and made
            available to you subject to the terms below. By using the
            Services, you consent to the terms of this Agreement. If
            you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not
            use the Services and disable the Services in the
            preferences/security menu. </p>

            <h3>1. Use Of Service</h3>

            <p>Mozilla permits you to use the Services via the
            Product.  This Agreement will also govern the use of
            Services made available to you as a result of your
            installing any executable software upgrades to the Product
            provided to you by CentOS, where those Services replace
            and/or supplement the Services provided through use of the
            Product. In such a case, "the Product" shall also refer to
            such installed upgrades. However, if such upgrades are
            accompanied by a separate agreement from Mozilla, the
            terms of that agreement will govern.</p>

            <h3>2. Termination</h3>

            <p>If you breach this Agreement your right to use the
            Services will terminate immediately and without notice,
            but all provisions of this Agreement except the Use of
            Services (Paragraph 1) will survive termination and
            continue in effect.  </p>

            <h3>3. Proprietary Rights</h3>

            <p> Subject to this Agreement and to all applicable
            licensing terms governing your use of the Product,
            Mozilla, for itself and on behalf of its licensors, hereby
            reserves all intellectual property rights in the Services,
            except for the rights expressly granted in this Agreement.
            You may not remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright
            or other proprietary notice in or on the Product. This
            agreement does not grant you any right to use the
            trademarks, service marks or logos of Mozilla or its
            licensors.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
            to limit any rights granted under open source licenses
            applicable to the Product and to corresponding source code
            versions of the Product.  </p>

            <h3>4. Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>The Mozilla Firefox Privacy Policy is made available
            online at <a
            href="http://www.mozilla.com/legal/privacy/">http://www.mozilla.com/legal/privacy/</a>,
            as that policy may be updated from time to time. </p>

            <h3>5. Website Information Services</h3>

            <p>Mozilla and its contributors, licensors and partners
            work to provide the most accurate and up-to-date phishing
            and malware information. However, they cannot guarantee
            that this information is comprehensive and error-free:
            some risky sites may not be identified, and some safe
            sites may be identified in error. </p>

            <h3>6. Disclaimer Of Warranty</h3>

            <p>The product and services are provided "as is" with all
            faults.  to the extent permitted by law, mozilla and
            mozilla's distributors, and licensors hereby disclaim all
            warranties, whether express or implied, including without
            limitation warranties that the product and services are
            free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular
            purpose and non-infringing.  you bear the entire risk as
            to selecting the product and services for your purposes
            and as to the quality and performance of the product and
            services. this limitation will apply notwithstanding the
            failure of essential purpose of any remedy. some
            jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to
            you.</p>

            <h3>7. Limitation Of Liability</h3>

            <p>Except as required by law, mozilla and its
            distributors, directors, licensors, contributors and
            agents (collectively, the "mozilla group") will not be
            liable for any indirect, special, incidental,
            consequential or exemplary damages arising out of or in
            any way relating to this agreement or the use of or
            inability to use the product and the services, including
            without limitation damages for loss of goodwill, work
            stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, and computer failure
            or malfunction, even if advised of the possibility of such
            damages and regardless of the theory (contract, tort or
            otherwise) upon which such claim is based. the mozilla
            group's collective liability under this agreement will not
            exceed the greater of $500 (five hundred dollars) and the
            fees paid by you under the license (if any). some
            jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
            incidental, consequential or special damages, so this
            exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.</p>

            <h3>8. U.S. Goverment End-Users</h3>

            <p>This Product is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial
            computer software" and "commercial computer software
            documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
            (Sept. 1995) and 48 C.F.R.  227.7202 (June 1995).
            Consistent with 48 C.F.R.  12.212, 48 C.F.R.  27.405(b)(2)
            (June 1998) and 48 C.F.R.  227.7202, all U.S.  Government
            End Users acquire the Product with only those rights as
            set forth therein.  </p>

            <p>(f) Except as required by law, the controlling language
            of this Agreement is English. </p>
