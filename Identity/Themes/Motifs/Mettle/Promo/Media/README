Basic Syntax:

    ./render.sh version architecture filename

Here version, architecture, and filename are filters used to render
the image.

         version: is the CentOS version you want to render images for.
                  For example: 3, 4, 5, 5.3, 6

    architecture: is the CentOS architecture you want to render images
                  for. For example: i386, x86_64. 

        filename: is a filter used to reduce the image rendering. It
                  is has the form of a regular expresion. It should
                  match any of the following values: label, sleeve,
                  cd, dvd or combination of them.

If you need to render many versions, and architectures at the same
time then you can used the render-m.sh script. For example to render
versions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for i386 and x86_64 architecture you can
run the following:

    ./render.sh '2 3 4 5 6' 'i386 x86_64'

If you need to do that just for label images then add the filename
filter to the above command. For example 

    ./render.sh '2 3 4 5 6' 'i386 x86_64' 'label'
