    # Append the current working directory when the location provided
    # isn't absolute.

    fi

    # Remove both consecutive slashes and trailing slashes from final
    # location.
    echo "${LOCATION}" | sed -r -e 's,/+,/,g' -e 's,/+$,,g'

    # The single slash form doesn't point to repository's root
    # directory anymore. Instead, when a single slash is passed
    # as argument through the command-line, it preserves its regular
    # meaning which is pointing the workstation's file system.

    # The path verification isn't appropriate here because this
    # function is commonly used inside variable assignments and flow
    # control doesn't take place in such situation. In case path
    # verification fails here, the script wouldn't end its execution
    # which contradicts the expected behaviour.
