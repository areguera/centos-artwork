This section describes The CentOS Brand design models.

@subheading Description

The CentOS Brand provides the one unique name or trademark that
connects the producer with their products. In this case, the producer
is The CentOS Project and the products are The CentOS Project visual
manifestations. 

The CentOS Brand is the main visual representation of the CentOS
project so the typography used in it must be the same always, no
matter where it be shown. It also has to be clear enough to dismiss
any confussion between similar typefaces (e.g., the number one (1)
sometimes is confuesed with the letter @samp{el} (l) or letter
@samp{ai} (i)). 

As convenction, the word @samp{CentOS} uses @samp{Denmark} typography
as base, both for the word @samp{CentOS} and the phrase
@samp{Community Enterprise Operating System}. The phrase size of
CentOS logo is half the size in poits the word @samp{CentOS} has and
it below @samp{CentOS} word and aligned with it on the left.  The
distance between @samp{CentOS} word and phrase @samp{Community
Enterprise Operating System} have the size in points the phrase has.

When the CentOS release brand is built, use @samp{Denmark} typography
for the release number. The release number size is two times larger
(in height) than default @samp{CentOS} word. The separation between
release number and @samp{CentOS} word is twice the size in points of
separation between @samp{CentOS} word and phrase @samp{Community
Enterprise Operating System}.

Another component inside CentOS logo is the trademark symbol (TM).
This symbol specifies that the CentOS logo must be consider a product
brand, even it is not a registered one. The trademark symbol uses
DejaVu LGC Sans Regular typography. The trademark symbol is aligned
right-top on the outter side of @samp{CentOS} word. The trademark
symbol must not exceed haf the distance, in points, between
@samp{CentOS} word and the release number on its right.

It would be very convenient for the CentOS Project and its community
to to make a registered trademark (Â®) of CentOS logo. To make a
register trademark of CentOS Logo prevents legal complications in the
market place of brands. It grants the consistency, through time, of
CentOS project corporate visual identity.
