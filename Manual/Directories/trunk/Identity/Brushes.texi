@subsection Goals

This section describes how brushes are organized in the repository and
how to make them available for you to use in @acronym{GIMP,GNU Image
Manipulation Program}.

@subsection Description

A brush is a pixmap or set of pixmaps used for painting through an
image manipulation program like GIMP.  Inside the repository, we've
organized brushes in @emph{common brushes} and @emph{theme-specific
brushes}.  In both cases, brushes are initially created in @file{.xcf}
format and later exported to any of the brush formats recognized by
GIMP (e.g., @file{.gbr} or @file{.gih}) using the same name of its
source file.

In order for both common brushes and theme-specific brushes to be
loaded by GIMP, related @file{.gbr} and @file{.gih} brush files need
to be stored under @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} directory. This location
is out of CentOS Artwork Repository and provides no version control by
itself. This way, brushes aren't exported to this location but into
the repository directory structure which is versioned. Later, we
create symbolic links in @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} to connect file
brushes inside the repository and, this way, provide the configuration
needed by GIMP to use the brush files produced inside the repository.

@quotation
@strong{Warning}
When brushes are added to or removed from the repository, you need to
update your working copy and all information related to brushes inside
your workstation (e.g., brush links in @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} and
the Brushes panel in GIMP).  Otherwise, you may end up with broken
links or brushes in the repository that wouldn't be available for you
to use in GIMP.
@end quotation

Inside the repository, common brushes and theme-specific brushes are
created individually in different locations, but they all are linked
from one unique location (i.e., @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes}).  This
configuration may provoke brush overlapping if a name convenction is
not implemented correctly.  In that sake, file names used for brushes
inside the repository must be unique, no matter where they be.

As file name convenction inside the repository, brushes are named
using lowercase letters, numbers, minus characters and dot characters,
only.  Additionally, when links are built, we use one suffix for those
brushes retrived from @file{trunk/Identity/Brushes} and another suffix
for those brushes retrivided from theme-specific directories.  Using
both the brush file name and the suffix information,  it is possible
to build unique names for links under @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes}
directory, scalably.

@end verbatim

@end float

Brushes produced with GIMP has a description field associated that is
shown in the Brushes panel of GIMP.  This description is set when the
brush is created as @file{.xcf} file and can be updated when it is
exported either to @file{.gbr} or @file{.gih} format. It wouldn't be
too useful to have two or more brushes using the same description so,
we also make description of brush files unique, too. In that sake, we
use the same name schema used to name brush links as description but
without including the file extension (e.g., if we have the
@file{centos-flame-3.gbr} brush, its description would be
@code{centos-flame-3}).

@subsection Usage

The way you use brushes is up to your creativeness. However, the way
brushes are made available needs to be standardized. That's the reason
of organizing brushes in common brushes and theme-specific brushes.

@subsection Common brushes

Common brushes exist to organize brushes that can be used anywhere
inside the repository. Inside the repository, common brushes under
@file{trunk/Identity/Brushes} are mainly used to hold brand
information related to The CentOS Project (e.g., symbols, logos,
trademarks, etc.).

Common brushes are always made available under
@file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} directory after preparing the repository
(@pxref{Directories trunk Scripts Functions Prepare}).

@subsection Theme-specific brushes

Theme-specific brushes exist to organize brushes that can be used
inside specific artistic motifs only. Inside the repository,
theme-specific brushes are stored in a directory named @file{Brushes}
which is stored in the first directory level under the artistic motif
directory structure. Each artistic motif inside the repository has its
own @file{Brushes} directory and uses it to store brushes that can be
considered auxiliars to that artistic motif construction.

Theme-specific brushes aren't made available under
@file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} directory after preparing the repository.
In order to make theme-specific brushes available under
@file{~/.gimp-2.2./brushes} it is required to activate/deactivate them
using the @code{theme} functionality of @command{centos-art.sh}
script. @c (@pxref{Directories trunk Scripts Functions Theme}).
