@subheading Description

This command looks for @samp{.sh} files inside Bash directory and
extracts translatable strings from files, using @command{xgettext}
command, in order to create a portable object template
(@file{centos-art.sh.pot}) file for them.

With the @file{centos-art.sh.pot} file up to date, the
@command{centos-art} command removes the temporal list of files sotred
inside @file{/tmp} directory and checks the current language of your
user's session to create a portable object file for it, in the
location @file{$CLI_LANG/$CLI_LANG.po}. 

The @var{CLI_LANG} variable discribes the locale language used to
output messages inside @command{centos-art} command. The locale
language used inside @command{centos-art} command is taken from the
@env{LANG} environment variable.  The @var{CLI_LANG} variable has the
@samp{LL_CC} format, where @samp{LL} is a language code from the
ISO-639 standard, and @samp{CC} a country code from the ISO-3166
standard.

The @env{LANG} environment variable is set when you do log in to your
system. If you are using a graphical session, change language to your
native language and do login. That would set and exoprt the @env{LANG}
environment variable to the correct value. On the other side, if you
are using a text session edit your @file{~/.bash_profile} file to set
and export the @env{LANG} environment variable to your native locale
as defines the @command{locale -a} command output; do logout, and do
login again.

At this point, the @env{LANG} environment variable has the appropriate
value you need, in order to translate @command{centos-art.sh} messages
to your native language (the one set in @env{LANG} environment
variable). 

With the @file{$CLI_LANG/$CLI_LANG.po} file up to date, the
@command{centos-art} opens it for you to update translation strings.
The @command{centos-art} command uses the value of @var{EDITOR}
environment variable to determine your favorite text editor. If no
value is defined on @var{EDITOR}, the @file{/usr/bin/vim} text editor
is used as default.

When you finishd PO file edition and quit text editor, the
@command{centos-art} command creates the related machine object in the
location @file{$CLI_LANG/LC_MESSAGES/$TEXTDOMAIN.mo}.

At this point, all translations you made in the PO file should be
available to your language when runing @command{centos-art.sh} script. 

In order to make the @command{centos-art.sh} internationalization, the
@command{centos-art.sh} script was modified as described in the
@command{gettext} info documentation (@command{info gettext}).  You
can find such modifications in the following files:

@item @file{trunk/Scripts/Bash/initFunctions.sh}
@item @file{trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Help/cli_localeMessages.sh}
@item @file{trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Help/cli_localeMessagesStatus.sh}
