@subheading Goals

The @file{trunk/} directory structure implements the Subversion's
trunk concept in a trunk, branches, tags repository structure.

@subheading Description

The @file{trunk/} directory structure provides the main development
line inside the CentOS Artwork Repository.


@subsubheading Automation

The automation work line exists to standardize content production in
CentOS Artwork Repository. There is no need to type several tasks,
time after time, if they can be programmed into just one executable
script.

In this section you'll find how to organize and extend the
@command{centos-art.sh} script, a bash scripts specially designed to
automate most frequent tasks in the repository (e.g., image rendition,
documenting directory structures, translating content, etc.).  If you
can't resist the idea of automating repeatable tasks, then take a look
here.
