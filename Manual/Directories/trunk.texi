@subsection Goals

This directory implements the Subversion's trunk concept in a
trunk, branches, tags repository structure.

@subsection Description

The @file{trunk/} directory structure is the main development line
inside the CentOS Artwork Repository and organizes the following
sections:

@table @strong
@item Identity

This section describes the implementation of The CentOS Project
Corporate Identity. This place is perfect to consolidate @emph{The
CentOS Artwork SIG}. If you are interested in producing art works for
The CentOS Project, this place is for you. 

@xref{Directories trunk Identity}, for more information.

@item Scripts

This section describes the implementation of @command{centos-art.sh}
script, a bash scripts specially designed to automate most frequent
tasks in the repository (e.g., image rendition, documenting directory
structures, translating content, etc.).  If you can't resist the idea
of automating repeatable tasks, then take a look here.

@xref{Directories trunk Scripts}, for more information.

@item Manual

This section organizes the @emph{CentOS Artwork Repository Manual}
(i.e., the documentation manual you're reading right now).  If you are
interested on improving The CentOS Artwork Repository Manual, in this
place you'll find the Texinfo documentation structure you need to work
with.

@xref{Directories trunk Manual}, for more information.

@item Locales

This section organizes production of translation messages for
@emph{Identity}, @emph{Documentation} and @emph{Scripts}. This place
is perfect to consolidate @emph{The CentOS Translation SIG}. If you
love translating, you'll find lot of messages waiting for you to
translate here.  

@xref{Directories trunk Locales}, for more information.
