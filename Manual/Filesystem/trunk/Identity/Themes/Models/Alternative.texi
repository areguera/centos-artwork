@subsection Description

CentOS alternative theme models exist for people how want to use a
different visual style on their installations of CentOS distribution.
As the visual style is needed for a system already installed
components like Anaconda are not required inside alternative themes.
Inside alternative themes you find post-installation visual style only
(i.e.  Backgrounds, Display Managers, Grub, etc.).  CentOS alternative
themes are maintained by CentOS Community.
