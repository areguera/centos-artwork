This directory implements the concept of @emph{Default Design Models
for CentOS Themes}.  Default Design Models for CentOS Themes provide
the common structural information (e.g., image dimensions, translation
markers, trademark position, etc.) the @command{centos-art} script
uses to produce images when no other design model is specified.

Deisgn models in this directory do use the CentOS Release Brand. The
CentOS Release Brand is a combination of both The CentOS Type and The
CentOS Release Schema used to illustrate the major release of CentOS
Distribution the image produced belongs to.  @xref{Filesystem trunk
Identity Models Tpl Brands}, for more information.

following components:
