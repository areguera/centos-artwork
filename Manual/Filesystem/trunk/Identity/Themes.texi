The @file{trunk/Identity/Themes/} directory exists to organize
production of CentOS themes.

@subsection Description

@subsection Usage

In this location themes are organized in ``Models'' ---to store common
information--- and ``Motifs''---to store unique information.  At
rendering time, both motifs and models are combined to produce the
final CentOS themes.  CentOS themes can be tagged as ``Default'' or
``Alternative''. CentOS themes are maintained by CentOS community.
