 If you find an error in the CentOS Artwork Repository Manual, or if
 you have thought of a way to make this manual better, we would like
 to hear from you! Submit a report in Bugzilla
 (http://bugzilla.centos.org/bugzilla/) against the component
 CentOS_Artwork_Repository_Manual.

 If you have a suggestion for improving the documentation, try to be
 as specific as possible. If you have found an error, include the
 section number and some of the surrounding text so we can find it
 easily.
