Welcome to the @emph{CentOS Artwork Repository Manual}.

The CentOS Artwork Repository Manual contains information on how to
produce the CentOS Corporate Visual Identity in the working copies of
CentOS Artwork Repository
(@url{https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork/}). If you are looking
for a comprehensive, task-oriented guide for understanding how the
CentOS Corporate Visual Identity is produced, this is the manual for
you.

This manual discusses the following intermedite topics: 

@itemize
@item The CentOS Brand
@item The CentOS Corporate Visual Structure
@item The CentOS Corporate Visual Style
@end itemize

This manual is organized in the same way the CentOS Artwork Repository
directory structure does. In the CentOS Artwork Repository we use
directories to store conceptual ideas of CentOS Corporate Visual
Identity.  For this manual sake, each directory in the CentOS Artwork
Repository has its own documentation section to describe the related
conceptual ideas of it.

This manual uses Texinfo as base documentation system. The Texinfo
documentation structure is controlled by the @command{centos-art}
script which is used to perform most common documentation tasks (e.g.,
edition, deletion, renaming, updating nodes, menus and cross
references) in a standard way.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of your CentOS
system. If you need help with CentOS, refer to the help page on the
CentOS Wiki (@url{http://wiki.centos.org/Help}) for a list of
different places you can find help.
