Welcome to @command{centos-art.sh} script manual.

The @command{centos-art.sh} manual contains information on how to use
the @command{centos-art.sh} script to help you achieve high production
levels when you work on The CentOS Project Corporate Visual Identity
inside the CentOS Artwork Repository
(@url{https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork/}).  If you are looking
for a comprehensive, task-oriented guide for understanding how The
CentOS Project corporate visual identity is produced, this is the
manual for you.

This manual discusses the following intermedite topics: 

@itemize
@item The CentOS Brand
@item The CentOS Corporate Visual Structure
@item The CentOS Corporate Visual Style
@end itemize

This manual is organized in the same way of CentOS Artwork Repository
directory structure. In the CentOS Artwork Repository we use
directories to store conceptual ideas of The CentOS Project Corporate
Visual Identity.  For this manual sake, each directory in CentOS
Artwork Repository has its own documentation section to describe the
related conceptual ideas it is based on.

This manual uses Texinfo as base documentation system. The Texinfo
documentation structure is controlled by the @code{help} functionality
of @command{centos-art.sh} script.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of your CentOS
system. If you need help with CentOS, refer to the help page on the
CentOS Wiki (@url{http://wiki.centos.org/Help}) for a list of
different places you can find help.
