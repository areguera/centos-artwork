In this manual, certain words are represented in different fonts,
typefaces, sizes, and weights. This highlighting is systematic;
different words are represented in the same style to indicate their
inclusion in a specific category. The types of words that are
represented this way include the following:

@table @command
@item command

Linux commands (and other operating system commands, when used) are
represented this way. This style should indicate to you that you can
type the word or phrase on the command line and press Enter to invoke
a command. Sometimes a command contains words that would be displayed
in a different style on their own (such as file names). In these
cases, they are considered to be part of the command, so the entire
phrase is displayed as a command. For example:

Use the @command{cat testfile} command to view the contents of a file,
named testfile, in the current working directory.
@end table

@table @file
@item file name

File names, directory names, paths, and RPM package names are
represented this way. This style indicates that a particular file or
directory exists with that name on your system. Examples:

The @file{.bashrc} file in your home directory contains bash shell
definitions and aliases for your own use.

The @file{/etc/fstab} file contains information about different system
devices and file systems.

Install the @file{webalizer} RPM if you want to use a Web server log
file analysis program.
@end table

@table @key
@item key

A key on the keyboard is shown in this style. For example:

To use @key{TAB} completion to list particular files in a directory,
type @command{ls}, then a character, and finally the Tab key. Your
terminal displays the list of files in the working directory that
begin with that character.  key-combination

A combination of keystrokes is represented in this way. For example:

The @key{Ctrl-Alt-Backspace} key combination exits your graphical
session and returns you to the graphical login screen or the console.
@end table
