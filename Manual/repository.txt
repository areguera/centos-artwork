CentOS Artwork Repository
*************************

This manuals documents relevant information regarding the deployment,
organization, and administration of CentOS Artwork Repository.

1 Introduction
**************

Welcome to the _CentOS Artwork Repository Manual_.

   The CentOS Artwork Repository Manual contains information on how to
produce the CentOS Corporate Visual Identity in the working copies of
CentOS Artwork Repository (`https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork/').
If you are looking for a comprehensive, task-oriented guide for
understanding how the CentOS Corporate Visual Identity is produced,
this is the manual for you.

   This manual discusses the following intermedite topics:

   * The CentOS Brand

   * The CentOS Corporate Visual Structure

   * The CentOS Corporate Visual Style

   This manual is organized in the same way the CentOS Artwork
Repository directory structure does. In the CentOS Artwork Repository
we use directories to store conceptual ideas of CentOS Corporate Visual
Identity.  For this manual sake, each directory in the CentOS Artwork
Repository has its own documentation section to describe the related
conceptual ideas of it.

   This manual uses Texinfo as base documentation system. The Texinfo
documentation structure is controlled by the `centos-art' script which
is used to perform most common documentation tasks (e.g., edition,
deletion, renaming, updating nodes, menus and cross references) in a
standard way.

   This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of your CentOS
system. If you need help with CentOS, refer to the help page on the
CentOS Wiki (`http://wiki.centos.org/Help') for a list of different
places you can find help.

1.1 Document Convenctions
=========================

In this manual the word _we_, as personal pronoun, is used to repesent
_The CentOS Artwork SIG_, the group of persons building the CentOS
Artwork Repository.

   In this manual, certain words are represented in different fonts,
typefaces, sizes, and weights. This highlighting is systematic;
different words are represented in the same style to indicate their
inclusion in a specific category. The types of words that are
represented this way include the following:

`command'
     Linux commands (and other operating system commands, when used) are
     represented this way. This style should indicate to you that you
     can type the word or phrase on the command line and press Enter to
     invoke a command. Sometimes a command contains words that would be
     displayed in a different style on their own (such as file names).
     In these cases, they are considered to be part of the command, so
     the entire phrase is displayed as a command. For example:

     Use the `centos-art identity --render='path/to/dir'' command to
     produce contents inside the `trunk/Identity' directory structure.

`file name'
     File names, directory names, paths, and RPM package names are
     represented this way. This style indicates that a particular file
     or directory exists with that name on your system. Examples:

     The `init.sh' file in `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/' directory is the
     initialization script, written in Bash, used to automate most of
     tasks in the repository.

     The `centos-art' command uses the `ImageMagick' RPM package to
     convert images from PNG format to other formats.

<<key>>
     A key on the keyboard is shown in this style. For example:

     To use <TAB> completion to list particular files in a directory,
     type `ls', then a character, and finally the Tab key. Your
     terminal displays the list of files in the working directory that
     begin with that character.

<<key-combination>>
     A combination of keystrokes is represented in this way. For
     example:

     The <Ctrl-Alt-Backspace> key combination exits your graphical
     session and returns you to the graphical login screen or the
     console.

``computer output''
     Text in this style indicates text displayed to a shell prompt such
     as error messages and responses to commands. For example:

     The `ls' command displays the contents of a directory. For example:


     Config                           manual_renameEntry.sh
     manual_copyEntry.sh              manual_restoreCrossReferences.sh
     manual_deleteCrossReferences.sh  manual_searchIndex.sh

     The output returned in response to the command (in this case, the
     contents of the directory) is shown in this style.

   Additionally, we use several different strategies to draw your
attention to certain pieces of information. In order of urgency, these
items are marked as a note, tip, important, caution, or warning. For
example:

     *Note* Remember that Linux is case sensitive. In other words, a
     rose is not a ROSE is not a rOsE.

     *Tip* The directory `/usr/share/doc/' contains additional
     documentation for packages installed on your system.

     *Important* If you modify the DHCP configuration file, the changes
     do not take effect until you restart the DHCP daemon.

     *Caution* Do not perform routine tasks as root -- use a regular
     user account unless you need to use the root account for system
     administration tasks.

     *Warning* Be careful to remove only the necessary partitions.
     Removing other partitions could result in data loss or a corrupted
     system environment.

1.2 Send in Your Feedback

2 Repository File System
************************

The CentOS Artwork Repsotiroy File System is the place where we
organize The CentOS Project Corporate Visual Identity. The CentOS
Artwork Repository uses directories to organize files and describe
conceptual idea about corporate identity. Such conceptual ideas are
explained in each directory related documentation entry.

   In this chapter you'll learn what each directory inside The CentOS
Artwork Repository is for and so, how you can make use of them. For
that purpose, the following list of directories is available for you to
explore:

2.1 The `branches' Directory
============================

2.1.1 Goals
-----------

This directory implements the Subversion's branches concept in a trunk,
branches, tags repository structure.

2.1.2 Description
-----------------

The `branches/' directory structre provides the intermediate space for
creating several instances of `trunk/' directory structure for parallel
development and later merging changes back to `trunk/' in the same
parallel basis.

2.1.3 Usage
-----------

The `branches/' directory structure is unused, so far.

2.1.4 See also
--------------

   * *Note Filesystem tags::.

   * *Note Filesystem trunk::.

   * Subversion's book (`http://svnbook.red-bean.com/').

2.2 The `tags' Directory
========================

2.2.1 Goals
-----------

This directory implements the Subversion's tags concept in a trunk,
branches, tags repository structure.

2.2.2 Description
-----------------

The `tags/' directory structre provides frozen branches.  Generally, we
use frozen branches to make check-points in time for development lines
under `branches/' or `trunk/' directory structure.

2.2.3 Usage
-----------

The `tags/' directory structure is unused, so far.

2.2.4 See also
--------------

   * *Note Filesystem branches::.

   * *Note Filesystem trunk::.

   * Subversion's book (`http://svnbook.red-bean.com/').

2.3 The `trunk' Directory
=========================

2.3.1 Goals
-----------

This directory implements the Subversion's trunk concept in a trunk,
branches, tags repository structure.

2.3.2 Description
-----------------

The `trunk/' directory structure is the main development line inside
the CentOS Artwork Repository and organizes the following sections:

*Identity*
     This section organizes image production in different formats and
     some non-image formats like XHTML and text files, as well. This is
     the perfect place to consolidate _The CentOS Artwork SIG_. If you
     are interested in producing art works for The CentOS Project, this
     place is for you.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Identity::, for more information.

*Manual*
     This section organizes the _CentOS Artwork Repository Manual_
     (i.e., the documentation manual you're reading right now).  If you
     are interested on improving The CentOS Artwork Repository Manual,
     in this place you'll find the Texinfo documentation structure you
     need to work with.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Manual::, for more information.

*Scripts*
     This section organizes production of automation scripts specially
     designed to automate most frequent tasks in the repository (e.g.,
     image rendition, documenting directory structures, translating
     content, etc.).  If you can't resist the idea of automating
     repeatable tasks, then take a look here.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Scripts::, for more information.

*Locales*
     This section organizes production of translation messages for
     _Identity_, _Documentation_ and _Scripts_. This place is perfect
     to consolidate _The CentOS Translation SIG_. If you love
     translating, you'll find lot of messages waiting for you to
     translate here.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Locales::, for more information.

2.3.3 Usage
-----------

It seems to be no other use for this directory but to organize the
sections described above.

2.3.4 See also
--------------

   * *Note Filesystem branches::.

   * *Note Filesystem tags::.

   * Subversion's book (`http://svnbook.red-bean.com/').

2.4 The `trunk/Identity' Directory
==================================

2.4.1 Goals
-----------

The `trunk/Identity' directory structure implements _The CentOS Project
Corporate Identity_.

2.4.2 Description
-----------------

The CentOS Project corporate identity is the "persona" of the
organization known as The CentOS Project.  The CentOS Project corporate
identity plays a significant role in the way the CentOS Project, as
organization, presents itself to both internal and external
stakeholders. In general terms, the CentOS Project corporate visual
identity expresses the values and ambitions of the CentOS Project
organization, its business, and its characteristics.

   The CentOS Project corporate identity provides visibility,
recognizability, reputation, structure and identification to The CentOS
Project organization by means of _Corporate Design_, _Corporate
Communication_, and _Corporate Behaviour_.

2.4.2.1 Corporate Design
........................

The CentOS Project corporate design is applied to every single visual
manifestations The CentOS Project as organization wants to express its
existence. Examples of the most relevant visual manifestations inside
The CentOS Project are _The CentOS Distribution_, _The CentOS Web_ and
_The CentOS Stationery_.

   The CentOS Project corporate design is organized in the following
work-lines:

*The CentOS Brand*
     The CentOS Brand is the name or trademark that connects the
     producer with their products. In this case, the producer is The
     CentOS Project and the products are The CentOS Project visual
     manifestations.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Brands::, for more information.

*The CentOS Colors*
     The CentOS Fonts provides the color information used along The
     CentOS Project visual manifestations.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Colors::, for more information.

*The CentOS Fonts*
     The CentOS Fonts provides the typography information used along The
     CentOS Project visual manifestations.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Fonts::, for more information.

*The CentOS Themes*
     The CentOS Themes provides structural information and visual style
     information, as well, used along The CentOS Project visual
     manifestations.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Themes::, for more information.

2.4.2.2 Corporate Communication
...............................

The CentOS Project corporate communication is based on community
communication.  In that sake, the following media are available for
corporate communication:

   * The CentOS Mailing Lists (`http://lists.centos.org/').

   * The CentOS Forums (`http://forums.centos.org/').

2.4.2.3 Corporate Behaviour
...........................

The CentOS Project corporate behaviour is based on community behaviour.

2.4.2.4 Corporate Structure
...........................

The CentOS Project corporate structure is based on a _"monolithic
corporate structure"_. In this structure, we use one unique name (The
CentOS Brand) and one unique visual style (The CentOS Theme) in all The
CentOS Project visual manifestations.

   Inside a monolithic corporate visual identity structure, internal and
external stakeholders use to feel a strong sensation of uniformity,
orientation, and identification with the organization. No matter if you
are visiting web sites, using the distribution, or acting on social
events, the one unique name and one unique visual style connects them
all to say: _Hey! we are all part of The CentOS Project_.

   Other corporate structures have been considered as well, but they
introduce visual contradictions we consider important to be aware of.
In that sake, lets describe the idea of: _Producing one different
visual style for each major release of CentOS distribution_.

   The CentOS Project maintains near to four different major releases of
CentOS distribution parallely in time and that fact makes one part of
The CentOS Project structural design, but not the complete design.  In
order to produce the correct corporate structure for The CentOS Project
we need to concider all the visual manifestations The CentOS Project is
made of, not just one of them.

   If one different visual style is used for each major release of
CentOS distribution, which one of those different visual styles would
be the one used to cover other visual manifestations, like The CentOS
Webs and The CentOS Stationery? Why The CentOS Distribution we are using
shows one visual style and The CentOS Web sites a completly different
one?  Isn't them all part of the same project?

   Obviously, having just one visual style in all visual manifestations
for eternity would be a very boring thing and also would give the idea
of a visually dead project. So, there is no problem on creating a brand
new visual style for each new major release of CentOS distribution, in
order to refresh the CentOS distribution visual style; the problem does
is in not propagating the brand new visual style created for the new
release of CentOS Distribution to all other visual manifestations The
CentOS Project is made of, in a way The CentOS Project could be
recognized no matter what visual manifestation be in front of us. Such
lack of uniformity is what introduces the visual contradition we are
precisely trying to solve by mean of themes in the CentOS Artwork
Repository.

2.4.3 Usage
-----------

The `trunk/' directory structure is organize in renderable and
non-renderable directories. Generally, renderable directories contain
two non-renderable directories, one to store design templates (the
`Tpl/' directory), and another to store the content produced (the
`Img/' directory).

   In order to produce content inside the rendereble directories, you
can use the following command:


centos-art identity --render='trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir'

     *Warning* If the `centos-art' command-line is not found in your
     workstation, it is probably because you haven't prepared it for
     using The CentOS Artwork Repository yet. *Note Filesystem trunk
     Scripts Bash Cli Functions Verify::, for more information.

   This command takes one design template and creates an instance of it
in order to apply translation messages, if any. Later, using the design
template instance the command renders the final content based on
whether the design template instance is a SVG file or a Docbook file.
If the design template instace is a SVG file, the final content
produced is a PNG image. On the other hand, if the design template
instance is a Docbook file, the final content produced is a XHTML file.

   Additionally to base-rendition flow, the `centos-art' provides the
_post-rendition_ and _last-rendition_ rendition features.

   The post-rendition is applied to base file produced in the same
directory structure. For example, you can use post-rendition action to
render PNG base output into different outputs (e.g., JPG, PDF, etc.)
before passing to process the next file in the same directory structure.

   On the other hand, the last-rendition is applied to all files
produces by both base-rendition and post-rendition in the same directory
structure, just before passing to process a different directory
structure.  For example, the `Preview.png' image from Ksplash component
is made of three images. In order to build the `Preview.png' image as
part of `centos-art' rendition flow, we need to wait for all the
required images the `Preview.png' image is made of in order to combine
them all together.  This is something we can't do using post-rendition
actions.

   Another rendition feature you can find inside the `trunk/Identity'
directory structure is the _directory-specific rendition_ feature. The
directory-specific rendition feature combines both the post-rendition
feature and the last-rendition feature in order to render specific
directory structures in specific ways, automatically. This
configuration can speed up production of different components like
Syslinux, Grub, Gdm, Kdm and Ksplash that require intermediate formats
or even several independent files, in order to reach its final
construction. This is a way to programmatically describe how specific
art works are built in and organized inside The CentOS Artwork
Repository.  Such descriptions has beign added to `centos-art'
command-line to let you produce them all with just one single command,
as fast as your CPU could handle it.

   *Note Filesystem trunk Scripts Bash Cli Functions Identity::, for
more information about the `identity' functionality of `centos-art'
command-line interface.

Specially useful has been, and keep being, the book _Corporate
Identity_ by Wally Olins (1989). This is the main conceptual material
we've been using to build The CentOS Artwork Repository.

2.7 The `trunk/Identity/Fonts' Directory
========================================

2.7.1 Goals
-----------

This section exists to organize digital typographies used by the CentOS
project.

2.7.2 Description
-----------------

2.7.3 Usage
-----------

The CentOS corporate identity is attached to `DejaVu LGC' font-family.
Whatever artwork you design for CentOS project, that requires
typography usage, must be done using `DejaVu LGC' font-family.

*Recommendation-1:*
     For screen desings (e.g., anything that final destination will
     never be printed on paper or any medium outside computer screens)
     use `DejaVu LGC Sans' font-family.

*Recommendation-2:*
     For non-screen designs (e.g., anything that final desition will be
     printed on paper or any other medium outside computer screens) use
     `DejaVu LGC Serif' font-family. As convenction files described in
     this rule are stored under `Stationery' directories.

   The only execption for the two recommendations above is the
typography used inside CentOS logo. The CentOS logo is the main visual
representation of the CentOS project so the typography used in it must
be the same always, no matter where it be shown. It also has to be
clear enough to dismiss any confussion between similar typefaces (e.g.,
the number one (1) sometimes is confuesed with the letter `el' (l) or
letter `ai' (i)).

   As CentOS logo typography convenction, the word `CentOS' uses
`Denmark' typography as base, both for the word `CentOS' and the phrase
`Community Enterprise Operating System'. The phrase size of CentOS logo
is half the size in poits the word `CentOS' has and it below `CentOS'
word and aligned with it on the left.  The distance between `CentOS'
word and phrase `Community Enterprise Operating System' have the size
in points the phrase has.

   When the CentOS release brand is built, use `Denmark' typography for
the release number. The release number size is two times larger (in
height) than default `CentOS' word. The separation between release
number and `CentOS' word is twice the size in points of separation
between `CentOS' word and phrase `Community Enterprise Operating
System'.

   Another component inside CentOS logo is the trademark symbol (TM).
This symbol specifies that the CentOS logo must be consider a product
brand, even it is not a registered one. The trademark symbol uses
DejaVu LGC Sans Regular typography. The trademark symbol is aligned
right-top on the outter side of `CentOS' word. The trademark symbol
must not exceed haf the distance, in points, between `CentOS' word and
the release number on its right.

   It would be very convenient for the CentOS Project and its community
to to make a registered trademark (®) of CentOS logo. To make a
register trademark of CentOS Logo prevents legal complications in the
market place of brands. It grants the consistency, through time, of
CentOS project corporate visual identity.

     *Note* The information about trademarks and corporate identity is
     my personal interpretation of
     `http://en.wikipedia.org/Corporate_identity' and
     `http://en.wikipedia.org/Trademark' description. If you have
     practical experiences with these affairs, please serve yourself to
     improve this section with your reasons.

========================================================

2.16.1 Goals
------------

Organize scalable vector graphics (svg) to help describe the CentOS web
environment.

2.16.2 The CentOS web environment
---------------------------------

Inside CentOS corporate identity, the CentOS web environment is
considered a promotion component. The CentOS web environment is formed
by a central web application --to cover base needs (e.g., per-major
release information like release notes, lifetime, downloads,
documentation, support, security advisories, bugs, etc.)-- and many
different free web applications --to cover specific needs (e.g., wiki,
mailing lists, etc.)--.

   The CentOS web environment is addressed to solve the following
issues:

   * One unique name and one unique visual style to all web
     applications used inside the web environment.

   * One-step navigation to web applications inside the environment.

   * High degree of customization to change the visual style of all web
     applications with few changes (e.g, updating just two or three
     images plus common style sheet [CSS] definitions).

   The CentOS project is attached to a monolithic corporate visual
identity (*note Filesystem trunk Identity::), where all visual
manifestations have one unique name and one unique visual style. This
way, the CentOS web environment has one unique name (the CentOS brand)
and one unique visual style (the CentOS default theme) for all its
visual manifestations, the web applications in this case.

   Since a maintainance point of view, achiving the one unique visual
style inside CentOS web environment is not a simple task. The CentOS
web environment is built upon many different web applications which
have different visual styles and different internal ways to customize
their own visual styles. For example: MoinMoin, the web application
used to support the CentOS wiki (`http://wiki.centos.org/') is highly
customizable but Mailman (in its 2.x.x serie), the web application used
to support the CentOS mailing list, doesn't support(1) a customization
system that separates presentation from logic, similar to that used by
MoinMoin.

   This visual style diversity complicates our goal of one unique visual
style for all web applications. So, if we want one unique visual style
for all web applications used, it is innevitable to modify the web
applications in order to implement the CentOS one unique visual style
customization in them. Direct modification of upstream applications is
not convenient because upstream applications come with their one visual
style and administrators take the risk of loosing all customization
changes the next time the application be updated (since not all
upstream web applications, used in CentOS web environment, separate
presentation from logic).

   To solve the "one unique visual style" issue, installation and
actualization of web applications --used inside CentOS web
environment-- need to be independent from upstream web applications
development line; in a way that CentOS web environment administrators
can install and update web applications freely without risk of loosing
the one unique visual style customization changes.

   At the surface of this issue we can see the need of one specific yum
repository to store CentOS web environment customized web applications.

2.16.2.1 Design model (without ads)
...................................

2.16.2.2 Design model (with ads)
................................

2.16.2.3 HTML definitions
.........................

2.16.2.4 Controlling visual style
.................................

Inside CentOS web environment, the visual style is controlled by the
following compenents:

*Webenv header background*

     trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Backgrounds/Img/1024x250.png

*CSS definitions*

     trunk/Identity/Themes/Models/Default/Promo/Web/CSS/stylesheet.css

2.16.2.5 Producing visual style
...............................

The visual style of CentOS web environment is defined in the following
files:


trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Backgrounds/Xcf/1024x250.xcf
trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Backgrounds/Img/1024x250.png
trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Backgrounds/Img/1024x250-bg.png
trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Backgrounds/Tpl/1024x250.svg

   As graphic designer you use `1024x250.xcf' file to produce
`1024x250-bg.png' file. Later, inside `1024x250.svg' file, you use the
`1024x250-bg.png' file as background layer to draw your vectorial
design. When you consider you artwork ready, use the `centos-art.sh'
script, as described below, to produce the visual style controller
images of CentOS web environment.


centos-art render --entry=trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Backgrounds --filter='1024x250'

   Once you have rendered required image files, changing the visual
style of CentOS web environment is a matter of replacing old image files
with new ones, inside webenv repository file system structure. The
visual style changes will take effect the next time customization line
of CentOS web applications be packaged, uploded, and installed from
[webenv] or [webenv-test] repositories.

2.16.2.6 Navigation
...................

Inside CentOS web environment, the one-step navegation between web
applications is addressed using the web environment navigation bar.
The web environment navigation bar contains links to main applications
and is always visible no matter where you are inside the web
environment.

2.16.2.7 Development and release cycle
......................................

The CentOS web environment development and relase cycle is described
below:

*Download*
     The first action is download the source code of web applications we
     want to use inside CentOS web environment.

          *Important* The source location from which web application are
          downloaded is very important. Use SRPMs from CentOS *[base]*
          and *[updates]* repositories as first choise, and third party
          repositories (e.g. RPMForge, EPEL, etc.) as last resource.

*Prepare*
     Once web application source code has been downloaded, our duty is
     organize its files inside `webenv' version controlled repository.

     When preparing the structure keep in mind that different web
     applications have different visual styles, and also different ways
     to implement it. A convenient way to organize the file system
     structure would be create one development line for each web
     application we use inside CentOS web environment. For example,
     consider the following file system structure:


     https://projects.centos.org/svn/webenv/trunk/
     |-- WebApp1/
     |   |-- Sources/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1/
     |   |-- Rpms/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1.rpm
     |   |-- Srpms/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1.srpm
     |   `-- Specs/
     |       `-- webapp1-0.0.1.spec
     |-- WebApp2/
     `-- WebAppN/

*Customize*
     Once web applications have been organized inside the version
     controlled repository file system, use subversion to create the
     CentOS customization development line of web applications source
     code.  For example, using the above file system structure, you can
     create the customization development line of `webapp1-0.0.1/' with
     the following command:


     svn cp trunk/WebApp1/Sources/webapp1-0.0.1 trunk/WebApp1/Sources/webapp1-0.0.1-webenv

     The command above creates the following structure:


     https://projects.centos.org/svn/webenv/trunk/
     |-- WebApp1/
     |   |-- Sources/
     |   |   |-- webapp1-0.0.1/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1-webenv/
     |   |-- Rpms/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1.rpm
     |   |-- Srpms/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1.srpm
     |   `-- Specs/
     |       `-- webapp1-0.0.1.spec
     |-- WebApp2/
     `-- WebAppN/

     In the above structure, the `webapp1-0.0.1-webenv/' directory is
     the place where you customize the visual style of `webapp1-0.0.1/'
     web application.

          *Tip* Use the `diff' command of Subversion between CentOS
          customization and upstream development lines to know what you
          are changing exactly.

*Build packages*
     When web application has been customized, build the web application
     RPM and SRPM using the source location with `-webenv' prefix.


     https://projects.centos.org/svn/webenv/trunk/
     |-- WebApp1/
     |   |-- Sources/
     |   |   |-- webapp1-0.0.1/
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1-webenv/
     |   |-- Rpms/
     |   |   |-- webapp1-0.0.1.rpm
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1-webenv.rpm
     |   |-- Srpms/
     |   |   |-- webapp1-0.0.1.srpm
     |   |   `-- webapp1-0.0.1-webenv.srpm
     |   `-- Specs/
     |       |-- webapp1-0.0.1.spec
     |       `-- webapp1-0.0.1-webenv.spec
     |-- WebApp2/
     `-- WebAppN/

*Release for testing*
     When the customized web application has been packaged, make
     packages available for testing and quality assurance. This can be
     achives using a [webenv-test] yum repository.

          *Note* The [webenv-test] repository is not shipped inside
          CentOS distribution default yum configuraiton. In order to use
          [webenv-test] repository you need to configure it first.

     If some problem is found to install/update/use the customized
     version of web application, the problem is notified somewhere (a
     bugtracker maybe) and the customization face is repated in order
     to fix the problem. To release the new package add a number after
     `-webenv' prefix. For example, if some problem is found in
     `webapp1-0.0.1-webenv.rpm', when it be fixed the new package will
     be named `webapp1-0.0.1-webenv-1.rpm'. If a problem is found in
     `webapp1-0.0.1-webenv-1.rpm', when it be fixed the new package
     will be named `webapp1-0.0.1-webenv-2.rpm', and so on.

     The "customization -- release for testing" process is repeated
     until CentOS quality assurance team considers the package is ready
     for production.

*Release for production*
     When customized web application packages are considered ready for
     production they are moved from [webenv-test] to [webenv]
     repository.  This action is commited by CentOS quality assurance
     team.

          *Note* The [webenv] repository is not shipped inside CentOS
          distribution default yum configuraiton. In order to use
          [webenv] repository you need to configure it first.

2.19.3 Usage
------------

In this location themes are organized in "Models" --to store common
information-- and "Motifs"--to store unique information.  At rendering
time, both motifs and models are combined to produce the final CentOS
themes.  CentOS themes can be tagged as "Default" or "Alternative".
CentOS themes are maintained by CentOS community.

2.20.2 Description
------------------

Theme models let you modeling characteristics (e.g., dimensions,
translation markers, position of each element on the display area,
etc.) common to all themes.  Theme models let you reduce the time
needed when propagating artistic motifs to different visual
manifestations.

   Theme models serves as a central pool of design templates for themes
to use. This way you can produce themes with different artistic motifs
but same characteristics.

2.20.3 Usage
------------

Inside the framework location above, you find theme models organized by
name. You can add your own theme models to the structure by adding a
directory to the list. By default you have the `*Note Default:
Filesystem trunk Identity Themes Models Default,' and `*Note
Alternative: Filesystem trunk Identity Themes Models Alternative,'
ready-to-use theme models.

Default Design Models for CentOS Themes provide design models for the
following components:

*Distribution*
     Design models for CentOS Distribution (e.g., Anaconda, Firstboot,
     Gdm, Grub, Gsplash, Kdm, Ksplash, Rhgb and Syslinux, etc.).  *Note
     Filesystem trunk Identity Themes Models Default Distro::, for more
     information.

*Concept*
     Design models to illustrate Artistic Motifs Concepts.  *Note
     Filesystem trunk Identity Themes Models Default Concept::, for
     more information.

*Promotion*
     Design models for CentOS Promotion stuff (e.g., installation media,
     posters, etc.). *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Themes Models
     Default Promo::, for more information.

2.22.2 Description
------------------

This directory implements the concept of _Default Design Models for
CentOS Themes_.  Default Design Models for CentOS Themes provide the
common structural information (e.g., image dimensions, translation
markers, trademark position, etc.) the `centos-art' script uses to
produce images when no other design model is specified.

   Deisgn models in this directory do use the _CentOS Release Brand_.
The CentOS Release Brand is a combination of both The CentOS Type and
The CentOS Release Schema used to illustrate the major release of
CentOS Distribution the image produced belongs to.  *Note Filesystem
trunk Identity Models Tpl Brands::, for more information.

2.22.3 Usage
------------

The CentOS Project maintains near to four different major releases of
CentOS Distribution. Each major release of CentOS Distribution has
internal differences that make them unique and, at the same time, each
CentOS Distribution individually is tagged into the one unique visual
manifestation (i.e., Distribution). So, how could we implement the
monolithic visual structure in one visual manifestation that has
internal difference?

   To answer this question we broke the question in two parts and later
combined the resultant answers to build a possible solution.

*How to remark the internal differences visually?*
     Merge both The CentOS Project Release Schema into The CentOS
     Project Trademark to build The CentOS Project Release Trademark.
     The CentOS Project Release Trademark remarks two things: first, it
     remarks the image is from The CentOS Project and second, it
     remarks which major release of CentOS Distribution does the image
     belongs to.  *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Models Tpl Brands::,
     for more information on how to develop and improve The CentOS
     Project Brand.

*How to remark the visual resemblance?*
     Use a common artistic motifs as background for all CentOS
     Distribution images.  *Note Filesystem trunk Identity Themes
     Motifs::, for more information.

*So, combining answers above, we could conclude that:*
     In order to implement the CentOS Monolithic Visual Structure on
     CentOS Distribution visual manifestations, a CentOS Release
     Trademark and a background information based on one unique
     artistic motif should be used in all remarkable images The CentOS
     Distribution visual manifestation is made of.

     *Important* Remarking the CentOS Release Schema inside each major
     release of CentOS Distribution --or similar visual
     manifestations-- takes _high attention_ inside The CentOS Project
     corporate visual identity. It should be very clear for everyone
     which major release of CentOS Distribution is being used.

2.24.2 Description
------------------

The CentOS Distribution visual style is controlled by image files.
These image files are packaged inside The CentOS Distribution and made
visible once such packages are installed and executed. The way to go
for changing The CentOS Distribution visual style is changing all those
image files to add the desired visual style first and later, repackage
them to make them available inside the final iso files of CentOS
Distribution.

2.24.3 Usage
------------

This directory provides organizationl structure to store default design
models for CentOS Themes of CentOS Distribution and so it should be
considered to be used.

   When a new component is added to CentOS Distribution, this is the
directory you need to go for specifying design models for image files
inside such component.

   The procedure to follow is creatig a directory for each component
using its very same name (e.g., the directory `Anaconda' stores image
files for Anaconda component, the installer program). Inside the
directory, you need to create one scalable vector graphic for each
image file inside the component you want to produce images for. This,
in order to set image dimensions, image file-name, position of
trademarks in the final image, translation markers and whatever common
information you need to have specified in them when rendered by
`centos-art' script.

   Sometimes, between major releases, image files inside packages can be
added, removed or just change their names. In order to describe such
image files variations, the design models directory structure is
organized in the same way the file variations are introduced (i.e.,
through The CentOS Project Release Schema).  So, each major release of
CentOS Distribution does have its own design model directory structure
in this directory.

   When a whole package is removed from one or all CentOS Distribution
major releases, the design models directory structure releated to it is
no longer used.  However it could be very useful for historical
reasons.  Also, someone could feel motivated enough to keep himself
documenting it or supporting it for whatever reason.

2.36.1 Goals

The `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs' directory exists to:

   * Organize CentOS themes' artistic motifs.

2.36.2 Description
------------------

The artistic motif of theme is a graphic design component that provides
the visual style of themes, it is used as pattern to connect all visual
manifestations inside one unique theme.

   Artistic motifs are based on conceptual ideas. Conceptual ideas bring
the motivation, they are fuel for the engines of human imagination.
Good conceptual ideas may produce good motivation to produce almost
anything, and art works don't escape from it.

`TreeFlower'
     CentOS like trees, has roots, trunk, branches, leaves and flowers.
     Day by day they work together in freedom, ruled by the laws of
     nature and open standards, to show the beauty of its existence.

`Modern'
     Modern, squares and circles flowing up.

   If you have new conceptual ideas for CentOS, then you can say that
you want to create a new artistic motif for CentOS. To create a new
artistic motif you need to create a directory under
`Identity/Themes/Motifs/' using a name coherent with your conceptual
idea. That name will be the name of your artistic motif. If possible,
when creating new conceptual ideas for CentOS, think about what CentOS
means for you, what does it makes you feel, take your time, think deep,
and share; you can improve the idea as time goes on.

   Once you have defined a name for your theme, you need to create the
motif structure of your theme. The motif structure is the basic
direcotry structure you'll use to work your ideas. Here is where you
organize your graphic design projects.

   To add a new motif structure to CentOS Artwork Repository, you need
to use the `centos-art' command line in the `Identity/Themes/Motifs/'
directory as described below:

     centos-art add --motif=ThemeName

   The previous command will create the basic structure of themes for
you.  The basic structure produced by `centos-art' command is
illustrated in the following figure:

     trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$ThemeName/
     |-- Backgrounds
     |   |-- Img
     |   `-- Tpl
     |-- Info
     |   |-- Img
     |   `-- Tpl
     |-- Palettes
     `-- Screenshots

2.36.3 Usage
------------

When designing artistic motifs for CentOS, consider the following
recommendations:

   * Give a unique (case-sensitive) name to your Motif. This name is
     used as value wherever theme variable ($THEME) or translation
     marker (=THEME=) is.  Optionally, you can add a description about
     inspiration and concepts behind your work.

   * Use the location `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/' to store
     your work. If it doesn't exist create it. Note that this require
     you to have previous commit access in CentOS Artwork Repository.

   * The CentOS Project is using the blue color (#204c8d) as base color
     for its corporate visual identity. Use such base corporate color
     information as much as possible in your artistic motif designs.

   * Try to make your design fit one of the theme models.

   * Feel free to make your art enterprise-level and beautiful.

   * Add the following information on your artwork (both in a visible
     design area and document metadata):

        * The name (or logo) of your artistic motif.

        * The copyright sentence: Copyright (C) YEAR YOURNAME

        * The license under which the work is released. All CentOS Art

2.37 The `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Flame' Directory
=======================================================

2.37.1 Goals
------------

This section describes the steps we followed to construct the _Flame_
artistic motif. This section may be useful for anyone interested in
reproducing the _Flame_ artistic motif, or in creating new artistic
motifs for The CentOS Project corporate visual identity (*note
Filesystem trunk Identity::).

2.37.2 Description
------------------

The _Flame_ artistic motif was built using the flame filter of Gimp 2.2
in CentOS 5.5.

   The flame filter of Gimp can produce stunning, randomly generated
fractal patterns. The flame filter of Gimp gives us a great oportunity
to reduce the time used to produce new artistic motifs, because of its
"randomly generated" nature. Once the artistic motif be created, it is
propagated through all visual manifestations of CentOS Project
corporate visual identity using the `centos-art.sh' script (*note
Filesystem trunk Scripts Bash::) inside the CentOS Artwork Repository.

   To set the time intervals between each new visual style production,
we could reuse the CentOS distribution major release schema.  I.e., we
could produce a new visual style, every two years, based on a new
"randomly generated" flame pattern, and publish the whole corporate
visual identity (i.e., distribution stuff, promotion stuff, websites
stuff, etc.) with the new major release of CentOS distribution all
together at once.

   Producing a new visual style is not one day's task. Once we have
defined the artistic motif, we need to propagate it through all visual
manifestations of The CentOS Project corporate visual identity. When we
say that we could produce one new visual style every two years we
really mean: to work two years long in order to propagate a new visual
style to all visual manifestations of The CentOS Project corporate
visual identity.

   Obviously, in order to propagate one visual style to all different
visual manifestations of The CentOS Project corporate visual identity,
we need first to know which the visual manifestations are.  To define
which visual manifestations are inside The CentOS Project corporate
visual identity is one of the goals the CentOS Artwork Repository and
this documentation manual are both aimed to satisfy.

   Once we define which the visual manifestation are, it is possible to
define how to produce them, and this way, organize the automation
process. Such automation process is one of the goals of `centos-art.sh'
script.

   With the combination of both CentOS Artwork Repository and
`centos-art.sh' scripts we define work lines where translators,
programmers, and graphic designers work together to distribute and
reduce the amount of time employed to produce The CentOS Project
monolithic corporate identity.

   From a monolithic corporate visual identity point of view, notice
that we are producing a new visual style for the same theme (i.e.,
_Flame_). It would be another flame design but still a flame design.
This idea is very important to be aware of, because we are somehow
"refreshing" the theme, not changing it at all.

   This way, as we are "refreshing" the theme, we still keep oursleves
inside the monolithic conception we are trying to be attached to (i.e.,
one unique name, and one unique visual style for all visual
manifestations).

   Producing artistic motifs is a creative process that may consume long
time, specially for people without experienced knowledge on graphic
design land. Using "randomly generated" conception to produce artistic
motifs could be, practically, a way for anyone to follow in order to
produce maintainable artistic motifs in few steps.

   Due to the "randomly generated" nature of Flame filter, we find that
_Flame_ pattern is not always the same when we use _Flame_ filter
interface.

   Using the same pattern design for each visual manifestation is
essential in order to maintain the visual connection among all visual
manifestations inside the same theme.  Occasionally, we may introduce
pattern variations in opacity, size, or even position but never change
the pattern design itself, nor the color information used by images
considered part of the same theme.

     *Important* When we design background images, which are considered
     part of the same theme, it is essential to use the same design
     pattern always.  This is what makes theme images to be visually
     connected among themeselves, and so, the reason we use to define
     the word "theme" as: a set of images visually connected among
     themeselves.

   In order for us to reproduce the same flame pattern always, _Flame_
filter interface provides the `Save' and `Open' options. The `Save'
option brings up a file save dialog that allows you to save the current
Flame settings for the plug-in, so that you can recreate them later.
The `Open' option brings up a file selector that allows you to open a
previously saved Flame settings file.

   The Flame settings we used in our example are saved in the file:


trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Flame/Backgrounds/Xcf/800x600.xcf-flame.def

2.37.3 Construction
-------------------

2.37.3.1 Step 1: Set image size
...............................

Create an empty image and fill the `Background' layer with black
(`000000') color. Image dimensions depend on the final destination you
plan to use the image for. For the sake of our construction example we
used an image of 640x480 pixels and 300 pixels per inch (ppi).

2.37.3.2 Step 2: Add base color and pattern information
.......................................................

Create a new layer named `Base', place it over `Background' layer and
fill it with the base color (`7800ff') you want to have your background
image set in.  Add a mask to `Base' layer using radial gradient and
blur it.  You may need to repeat this step more than once in order to
achieve a confortable black radial degradation on the right side of
your design.

   Duplicate `Base' layer and name it `Paper'. Place `Paper' layer over
`Base' layer. Remove content of `Paper' layer and fill it with `Paper
(100x100)' pattern.  Once you've done with black radial degradation,
reduce the `Paper' layer opacity to 20%.

   Notice that when we duplicate one layer, the mask information related
to layer is preserved from previous to next layer. This saves us some
of the time required to produce different layers with the same mask
information on them.

   Duplicate `Paper' layer and rename it `Stripes'. Remove paper
pattern from `Stripes' layer. Fill `Stripes' layer with `Stripes
(48x48)' pattern and reduce the `Stripes' layer opacity to 15%.

2.37.3.3 Step 3: Add flame motif
................................

Create a new layer named `Flame'. Set the foreground (`003cff') and
background (`0084ff') colors to the gradient you want to build the
flame motif.

   To build flame motif, use the flame filter (`Filters > Render >
Nature > Flame...') on `Flame' layer. We used a layer mask, with a
radial gradient on it to control the boundaries of flame motif on
`Flame' layer.

   Duplicate `Flame' layer and rename it `Flame Blur'. Place `Flame
Blur' below `Flame' layer. Apply Gussian blur filter (`Filters > Blur >
Gussian Blur...') until reaching the desiered effect.

   The opacity value, in `Flame' layers, may vary from one image to
another based on the place the image will be finally placed on.  For
example, images used as desktop background have the `Flame' layer
opacity set at 100% but `Flame Blur' is set to 70%.  However, you may
find that background images used in anaconda progress slides have
opacity reduced differently, in order to reduce brightness in a way
that texts could look clean and readable over it.

2.37.3.4 Step 4: Add foreground color
.....................................

Create a new layer named `Color', place it on top of all visible layers
and fill it with plain color (`4c005a'). Reduce `Color' layer opacity
to 20%. You can use the `Color' layer to control the right side color
information you want to produce the image for.

   Duplicate `Flame' layer and create a new layer named `Color#1'.
Place `Color#1' layer on top of layer named `Color'. Remove the mask
information from `Color#1' layer and recreate a new one using an
inverted alpha channel as reference.  Remove `Color#1' layer content
and fill it back with plain black (`000000') color. Reduce `Color#1'
opacity to 20%.  In this step we created a mask to protect the flame
artistic motif from black color, so when we decrement or increment the
opacity of layer, the flame artistic motif wouldn't be affected, just
the environment suround it.

   When you set color information, remember that the same artistic motif
needs to be indexed to 14 and 16 colors, in order to produce Grub and
Syslinux visual manifestations respectively. Using many different
colors in the artistic motif may reduce the possibility of your design
to fix all different situations in.  Likewise, using more colors in one
design, and less colors in another design will reduce the connectivity
among your designs, since color information is relevant to visual
identity.

   When you propagate your artistic motif visual style to different
visual manifestations of CentOS Project corporate visual identity, it
is up to you to find out justice and compromise among all possible
variables you may face.

2.39.1 Goals
------------

   * Organize background images for Modern theme.

2.39.2 Description
------------------

Inside `Motifs' directory, the `Backgrounds/' directory is used to
create vectorial designs using Inkscape and background images using
Gimp. Later, you can export background images as `.png' and load them
in your vectorial design project using the import feautre of Inkscape.

   You may need to repeat this technic for different screen resoluions.
In that case you need to create one file for each screen resolution and
do the appropriate linking inside .svg to .png files.  For example if
you need to produce background images in 800x600 you need to create the
following file:

     xcf/800x600.xcf

   to produce the background image:

     img/800x600-bg.png

   which is loaded in:

     svg/800x600.svg

   to produce the final background image:

     img/800x600.png

   The `img/800x600.png' background image is produced automatically by
means of rendering scripts.

   In other cases (e.g. Anaconda), it is possible that you need to make
some variations to one background image that don't want to appear on
regular background images of the same resolution. In this case you need
to create a new and specific background image for that art component.
For example, if you need to produce the background image used by
Anconda (800x600) art works you create the file:

     xcf/800x600-anaconda.xcf

   to produce the background image:

     img/800x600-anaconda-bg.png

   which is loaded in:

     svg/800x600-anaconda.svg

   to produce the file:

     img/800x600-anaconda.png

   The 800x600-anaconda.png file is used by all Anaconda art works
sharing a common 800x600 screen resolution (e.g., Header, Progress,
Splash, Firstboot, etc.). The Anaconda Prompt is indexed to 16 colors
and 640x480 pixels so you need to create a 640x480 background image for
it, and take the color limitation into account when designing it.

   Background images without artistic motif are generally used as based
to build the Background images that do contain the theme artistic motif.

   Background images are linked (using the import feature of Inkscape)
inside almost all theme art works. This structure let you make
centralized changes on the visual identity and propagate them quickly
to other areas.

   In this structure you design background images for different screen
resolutions based on the theme artistic motif.

   You may create different artistic motifs propositions based on the
same conceptual idea. The conceptual idea is what defines a theme.
Artistic motifs are interpretations of that idea.

   Inside this directory artistic motifs are organized by name (e.g.,
TreeFlower, Modern, etc.).

   Each artistic motif directory represents just one unique artistic
motif.

   The artistic motif is graphic design used as common pattern to
connect all visual manifestations inside one unique theme.  The
artistic motif is based on a conceptual idea.  Artistic motifs provide
visual style to themes.

   Designing artistic motifs is for anyone interested in creating
beautiful themes for CentOS.  When building a theme for CentOS, the
first design you need to define is the artistic motif.

   Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, theme visual styles (Motifs) and
theme visual structures (Models) are two different working lines.  When
you design an artistic motif for CentOS you concentrate on its visual
style, and eventualy, use the `centos-art' command line interface to
render the visual style, you are currently producing, against an
already-made theme model in order to produce the final result.  Final
images are stored under `Motifs/' directory using the model name, and
the model directory structure as reference.

   The artistic motif base structure is used by `centos-art' to produce
images automatically. This section describes each directory of CentOS
artistic motif base structure.

2.39.3 Usage
------------

The `Backgrounds/' directory is probably the core component, inside
`Motifs/' directory structure.  Inside `Backgrounds/' directory you
produce background images used by almost all theme models (e.g.,
Distribution, Websites, Promotion, etc.).  The `Backgrounds/' directory
can contain subdirectories to help you organize the design process.

2.46.2 Description
------------------

2.46.2.1 Desktop background
...........................

Once you have defined the vectorial artistic motif design, use the
`centos-art.sh' script (as described in usage section below) to produce
the png version of it. With the png version of your vectorial design do
the following:

   Open the png version with GIMP.

   Save the png version as a project of GIMP inside
`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Backgrounds/Xcf' directory,
using the same name of your vectorial design but with the `.xcf'
extension.

   Now use GIMP to improve your design.  Here you may add one layer for
pattern, another for colors, and so on until you find yourself
confortable with your artwork. For example,  the following layer
distribution (from bottom to top) was used to build revision 285 of
file `1360x768.xcf' using _TreeFlower_ artistic motif at revision 241.

*Layer 1: Background*
     The first thing we did with GIMP was to create a layer named
     `Background' to store the artistic motif (File > Open as layer).
     This layer is the lowest layer in the image.  Later, we started to
     create layers one upon another to change the artistic motif visual
     style.

*Layer 2: Shadow#1*
     This layer is above `Background' and contains a linear gradient
     from left (000000) to right (transparent) covering the whole image.
     This layer masks the artistic motif to avoid the effect of linear
     gradient. This layer is 100% of opacity.

*Layer 3: Shadow#2*
     This layer is above `Shadow#1' and contains a linear gradient from
     left (000000) to right (transparent) covering just the 70% of the
     whole image aproximatly. This layer doesn't mask the artistic motif
     which make the left part of it fall into the dark of linear
     gradient.  This layer is 100% of opacity.

*Layer 4: Pattern (Paper)*
     This layer is above `Shadow#2' an contains the paper pattern
     shipped with GIMP 2.2. This layer doesn't mask the artistic motif
     so the pattern is applied over the whole image. This layer is set
     to 15% of opacity.

*Layer 5: Pattern (Stripes)*
     This layer is above `Pattern (Paper)' and contains the stripes
     used over the artistic motif. This layer do masks the artistic
     motif so the stripes are only applied to it. This layer is set to
     10% of opacity.

*Layer 6: Shadow#3*
     This layer is above `Pattern (Stripes)' and contains a linear
     gradient from right (6600ff) to left (transparent).  This layer
     masks the artistic motif so the linear gradient doesn't affect it.
     This layer is set to 15% of opacity.

*Layer 7: Shadow#4*
     This layer is above `Shadow#3' and contains a linear gradient from
     left (000000) to right (transparent). This layer do masks the
     artistic motif so the linear gradient doesn't affect it.  This
     layer is set to 10% of opacity.

*Layer 8: Color#1*
     This layer is above `Shadow#4' and is filled with orange (ffae00)
     color over the whole image. This layer is set to 10% of opacity.

*Layer 9: Color#2*
     This layer is above `Color#1' and is filled with blue (010a88)
     color over the whole image. This layer is set to 10% of opacity.


     *Note* There is no definite combination. To get the appropriate
     visual design is a matter of constant testing and personal taste.

   Finally, use `Save as copy ...' option to export the final design.
To export the final design use the same name of your vectorial design
plus `-final.png' extension.

   You can repeat these steps to create images for other screen
resolutions.

2.46.2.2 Anaconda Prompt (syslinux) background
..............................................

When building syslinux backgrounds it is needed to take into account
that the final image is reduced to 16 colors. In desktop background
there is no color limitation but syslinux does have. The goal of this
section is achieving a final syslinux background as close as possible
to desktop backgrounds using 16 colors only.

   Another point to consider is the forground and background definition
used by syslinux. The syslinux documentation says that the color set in
position 0 is the background and color set in position 7 is the
forground. The final palette of color used by our background will match
that specification. For great contrast we'll use black as background
and white as forground. At this poing we have black (000000) and white
(ffffff) colors in our syslinux palette, which left us with 14 colors
to play with.

   Let's begin with `Xcf/640x300.xcf' layer distribution from bottom to
top:

*Layer 1: Background*
     This layer is the lowest layer in the image composition and
     contains the artistic motif image rendered for the same resolution
     (i.e., `Img/Png/640x300.png'). This layer is set to 100% of
     opacity.

*Layer 2: Pattern (Paper)*
     This layer is placed above `Background' layer and contains the
     paper pattern shipped with GIMP 2.2. This layer doesn't mask the
     artistic motif. This layer is set to 30% of opacity.

*Layer 3: Pattern (Stripes)*
     This layer is placed above `Pattern (Paper)' layer and contains
     the stripes pattern shipped with GIMP 2.2. This layer does mask the
     artistic motif in order to apply the stripes over it only. The
     background is not affected by the stripes pattern just the artistic
     motif. This layer is set to 20% of opacity.

*Layer 4: Shadow#1*
     This layer is placed above `Pattern (Stripes)' layer and fills the
     entire layer area with violet (6600ff) color. This layer do mask
     the artistic motif in order to applied the violet color to the
     background area outside the artistic motif only. This layer is set
     to 15% of opacity.

*Layer 5: Color#1*
     This layer is above `Shadow#1' and is filled with orange (ffae00)
     color to cover the whole image. This layer is set to 10% of
     opacity.

*Layer 6: Color#2*
     This layer is above `Color#1' and is filled with blue (010a88)
     color to cover the whole image. This layer is set to 10% of
     opacity.

*Layer 7: Shadow#2*
     This layer is above `Color#1' and contains a linear gradient from
     left (000000) to right (transparent) covering 70% of the image
     approximately.


   At this point we have the composition and should look like the
desktop backgrounds. Compared with desktop backgrounds there are some
differences in opacity. This is because in our testings the final color
information found with this composition produces an acceptable 16 color
image. Of course this is something we haven't seen yet.

   To define the color information of our current coposition, save the
syslinux background composition we've done using `File > Save as Copy
...' option in the following location:


trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Backgrounds/Img/Png/640x300-final.png

   Now, create the final png version of syslinux backgrounds using the
following command:


centos-art render --entry=trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro/Anaconda/Prompt

   This command will create syslinux-splash final images for all major
releases of CentOS distribution the repository has been configured to.
The important files here are `syslinux-splash.png', other files may
contain the wrong information because we haven't defined yet the
correct color information to use.

   Open one `syslinux-splash.png' file with GIMP and use the `Image >
Mode > Indexed' to reduce image colors up to 16 colors, using the
`Generate optimum palette' feature of GIMP.  If the image looks
aceptable after reducing colors, use the `Palettes' menu (Ctrl+P) of
GIMP to import a new palette from file and name it
`CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux'. Once you've saved the palette, the color
information is stored at:


~/.gimp-2.2/palettes/CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux.gpl

   You need to edit `CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux.gpl' file in order to
set the appropriate order of colors.  Remember black (000000) in
position 0, and white (ffffff) in position 7. Other positions are
irrelevant. When editing this file you may find that color reduction
did not set black and white colors to their respective values exactly.
Change that manually. For example, consider the following palette:


GIMP Palette
Name: CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux
Columns: 16
#
  0   0   0	Background (black)
 23  20  35	Untitled
 34  25  48	Untitled
 37  35  60	Untitled
 47  36  68	Untitled
 37  54  86	Untitled
 60  48  90	Untitled
255 255 255	Foreground (white)
 66  54  99	Untitled
 74  61  98	Untitled
 49  78 126	Untitled
 43  87 151	Untitled
 92  89  95	Untitled
 54 104 183	Untitled
158 153 156	Untitled
201 196 195	Untitled

   Update the `Palettes' menu to get the new color positions from the
file you just edited and open the palette with double click.

   Update the `syslinux.gpl' file copying the following file:


~/.gimp-2.2/palettes/CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux.gpl

   to


trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Colors/syslinux.gpl

   With the `CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux' palette opened in the `Palette
Editor', open (Ctrl+O) the following file:


trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Colors/syslinux.ppm

   and replace its color information with that one in
`CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux' palette.  When you are replacing color
information inside `syslilnux.ppm', remember to keep the order of
colors just as they are in the `CentOS-TreeFlower-Palette' palette.

   The `syslinux.ppm' file is 16 pixels width and 1 pixel height, so
you probably need to zoom it a bit to set the color information in
their place when using the pen tool with the brush `Circle (01) (1 x
1)'.

   Once you've updated the `syslinux.ppm' file, it is time to update
the following file:


trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Colors/syslinux.hex

   The `syslinux.hex' file contains the color information in
hexadecimal notation.  The color information in hexadecimal notation is
required by `ppmtolss16' command.  The `ppmtolss16' command produces
the final LSS16 image format that is used by syslinux program inside
CentOS distribution.

   The color information inside `syslinux.hex' must match the one in
`syslinux.ppm' and `syslinux.gpl'. For example, based on
`CentOS-TreeFlower-Syslinux' palette of colors above, consider the
following `syslinux.hex' file:


#000000=0
#171423=1
#221930=2
#25233c=3
#2f2444=4

2.48 The `trunk/Locales' Directory
==================================

The `trunk/Locales' directory exists to store the translation messages
used to produce content in different languages.

   Translation messages are organized using the directory structure of
the component being translated. For example, if we want to provide
translation messages for `trunk/Manuals/Filesystem', then the
`trunk/Locales/Manuals/Filesystem' directory needs to be created.

   Once the locale directory exists for the component we want to provide
translation messages for, it is necessary to create the translation
files where translation messages are. The translation files follows the
concepts of `xml2po' and GNU `gettext' tools.

   The basic translation process is as follow: first, translatable
strings are extracted from files and a portable object template (.pot)
is created or updated with the information. Using the portable object
template, a portable object (.po) is created or updated for translator
to locale the messages retrived.  Finally, a machine object (.mo) is
created from portable object to sotore the translated messages.

   Inside the repository there are two ways to retrive translatable
strings from files. The first one is through `xml2po' command and the
second through `xgettext' command. The `xml2po' is used to retrive
translatable strings from XML files (e.g., Scalable Vector Graphics,
DocBook, etc.) and the `xgettext' command is used to retrive
translatable strings from shell scripts files (e.g., the files that
make the `centos-art.sh' command-line interface).

   When translatable strings are retrived from XML files, using the
`xml2po' command, there is no need to create the machine object as we
do when translatable strings ar retrived from shell files, using the
`xgettext' command. The `xml2po' produces a temporal machine object in
order to create a translated XML file. Once the translated XML file has
been created the machine object is no longer needed. On the other hand,
the machine object produced by the `xgettext' command is required by
the system in order for the show shell script localized messages.

   Another difference between `xml2po' and `xgettext' we need to be
aware of is the directory structure used to store machine objects. In
`xml2po', the machine object is created in the current working
directory as `.xml2po.mo' and can be safetly removed once the
translated XML file has been created. In the case of `xgettext', the
machine object needs to be stored in the
`$TEXTDOMAIN/$LOCALE/LL_MESSAGES/$TEXTDOMAIN.mo' file in order for the
system to interpret it and should not be removed since it is the file
that contain the translation messages themselves.

   Automation of localization tasks is achived through the `locale'
functionality of command-line interface.

2.50 The `trunk/Locales/Identity/Brands' Directory
==================================================

2.50.1 Goals
------------

   * Organize brands' translation files.

2.50.2 Description
------------------

Translation files, inside `trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands'
translation entry, don't use default rendering translation
functionality, they use the following translation pre-rendering
configuration file instead:


/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Translation/Identity/Brands/render.conf.sh

   Inside `trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands' translation entry,
translation files are symbolic links pointing to the common template
translation structure, inside the translation template (`Tpl/')
directory.

   Inside `trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands' translation entry,
translation files are created using identity design templates as
reference.  The translation pre-rendering script creates a translation
structure where the translation template (`Tpl/') directory structure
applies to each single design template available.

   For example, if the brands' translation template (`Tpl/') directory
has 30 translation files, and there are 20 design templates; the
brands' translation pre-rendering script creates a translation
structure of symbolic links where the 30 translation files apply the 20
design templates one by one, producing 600 translation symbolic links
as result. At this point, when rendering identity, the `centos-art'
script considers translation symbolic links as translation files.

   Translation file names, inside brands' translation template (`Tpl')
directory have special meaning:

2.50.2.1 Conventional file names
................................

Convenctional file names look like `blue.sed', `2c-a.sed', etc.
Replacement commands inside translation file are applied to design
templates and translation file names are used as final image name.  The
image dimensions use the same dimensions that design template has.

2.50.2.2 Numeric file names
...........................

Numeric file names look like `300.sed', `200.sed', etc.  Replacements
commands inside translation files are applied to design templates, and
translation file names are used as final image name.  The final image
is saved using an specific `width' defined by the number part of the
translation file name. The image `height' is automatically scaled based
on the previous `width' definition to maintain the designing ratio.

   For example, if your design template has 400x200 pixels of dimension,
and you apply a translation file named `300.sed' to it, the final image
you get as result will have 300x100 pixels of dimension.   The same is
true if you use higher numbers like `1024.sed', `2048.sed', etc. In
these cases you have bigger images proportionally.

   As we are using scalable vector graphics to design identity
templates, the image size you produce is not limitted in size. You can
use one design template produced in 400x200 pixels to produce larger or
shorter PNG images using numeric translation files as described above.

2.50.2.3 Translation markers
............................

Inside `trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands/', translation files combine
the following translation markers:

`#000000'
     Specify which color to use when rendering brand images.

          *Note* As translation files inside
          `trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands' are symbolic links that
          point to template translation files, translation markers are
          defined inside template translation files.

2.50.3 Usage
------------

To render brands' translation files, use the following command:


centos-art render --translation=/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands

2.52 The `trunk/Locales/Identity/Fonts' Directory
=================================================

2.52.1 Goals
------------

This section exists to organize fonts translation files.

2.52.2 Description
------------------

Translation files, inside `trunk/Translations/Fonts', have the
following structure:


s!font-family:Denmark!font-family:DejaVu LGC Sans!
s!font-weight:normal!font-weight:bold!
s!font-style:normal!font-style:italic!

   Inside `trunk/Translations/Fonts', there is one translation file for
each font preview image you want to produce. This way, we create one
translation file for each font-family we use somewhere inside CentOS
visual identity.

     *Important* Do not create translation files for font-families not
     used somewhere inside CentOS visual identity. The identity of font
     entry (*note Filesystem trunk Identity Fonts::) is used as
     reference when someone needs to know which font-families are
     allowed to use inside CentOS visual identity.

2.52.2.1 Translation Markers
............................

Inside `trunk/Translations/Identity/Fonts', translation files combine
the following translation markers:

`font-family:Denmark'
     Specify which font family to use when rendering font preview
     images.

`font-weight:normal'
     Specify which font weight to use when rendering font preview
     images.

`font-style:normal'
     Specify which font style to use when rendering font preview images.

2.52.3 Usage
------------

Inside `trunk/Translations/Fonts' you use your favorite text editor to
create translation files.  Inside `trunk/Translations/Fonts' there is
not translation template directory (`Tpl/'), nor translation rendering
using `centos-art' script.  For example, to create the
`dejavu_lgc_sans-boldoblique.sed' translation file using `vim' editor,
type the following command:


vim /home/centos/artwork/trunk/Translations/Fonts/dejavu_lgc_sans-boldoblique.sed

2.57.1 Goals
------------

   * Organize Anaconda progress translation templates.

   * Organize Anaconda progress translation files in several languages
     and major releases of CentOS distribution.

2.57.2 Description
------------------

Use the following command to produce translation files based:

     trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/Anaconda/Progress
     `-- Tpl
         |-- en
         |   |-- 01-welcome.sed
         |   |-- 02-donate.sed
         |   `-- 03-yum.sed
         `-- es
             |-- 01-welcome.sed
             |-- 02-donate.sed
             `-- 03-yum.sed

   In order to produce the slide images in PNG format we need to have
the translation files first. So we use the following commands to create
translation files for CentOS 3, 4, and 5 major releases:

     centos-art render --translation --filter='3,4,5'

   The above commands will produce the following translation structure:

     trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/Anaconda/Progress
     |-- 3
     |   |-- en
     |   |   |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |   |   |-- 02-donate.sed
     |   |   `-- 03-yum.sed
     |   `-- es
     |       |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |       |-- 02-donate.sed
     |       `-- 03-yum.sed
     |-- 4
     |   |-- en
     |   |   |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |   |   |-- 02-donate.sed
     |   |   `-- 03-yum.sed
     |   `-- es
     |       |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |       |-- 02-donate.sed
     |       `-- 03-yum.sed
     |-- 5
     |   |-- en
     |   |   |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |   |   |-- 02-donate.sed
     |   |   `-- 03-yum.sed
     |   `-- es
     |       |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |       |-- 02-donate.sed
     |       `-- 03-yum.sed
     `-- Tpl
         |-- en
         |   |-- 01-welcome.sed
         |   |-- 02-donate.sed
         |   `-- 03-yum.sed
         `-- es
             |-- 01-welcome.sed
             |-- 02-donate.sed
             `-- 03-yum.sed

   At this point we have all the translation files we need to produce
Anaconda progress welcome, donate and yum slides images; in English and
Spanish languages; for CentOS 3, CentOS 4, and CentOS 5. That is, a sum
of 18 images around.

   Now, with translation files in place, let's move to `trunk/Identity'
structure and render them.

2.62 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash' Directory
=======================================

2.62.1 Goals
------------

The `trunk/Scripts/Bash' directory exists to organize the trunk
development line of `centos-art.sh' automation script.  The
`centos-art.sh' script standardizes frequent tasks inside your working
copy of CentOS Artwork Repository.

2.62.2 Description
------------------

The best way to understand `centos-art.sh' automation script is
studying its source code.  However, as start point, you may prefer to
read an introductory resume before diving into the source code details.

   The `centos-art.sh' script is written in Bash. Most tasks, inside
`centos-art.sh' script, have been organized in many specific
functionalities that you can invoke from the `centos-art' command-line
interface.

   When you type the `centos-art' command in your terminal, the
operating system trys to execute that command. In order to execute the
command, the operating system needs to know where it is, so the
operating system uses the PATH environment variable to look for that
command location. If your system was prepared to use CentOS Artwork
Repository correctly (-- *Removed*(pxref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions
Verify) --), you should have a symbolic link inside `~/bin/' directory
that points to the `centos-art.sh' script file. As `~/bin/' directory
is, by default, inside PATH environment variable, the execution of
`centos-art' command runs the `centos-art.sh' script.

   When `centos-art.sh' script is executed, the first it does is
executing the `trunk/Scripts/Bash/initEnvironment.sh' script to
initialize global variables (e.g., `gettext' variables) and global
function scripts.  Global function scripts are located inside
`trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions' directory and their file names begin
with `cli'. Global function scripts provide common functionalities that
can be used anywhere inside `centos-art.sh' script execution
environment.

   Once global variables and function scripts have been loaded,
`centos-art.sh' script executes the `cli' global function from `cli.sh'
function script to retrive command-line arguments and define some
default values that may be used later by specific function scripts (--
*Removed*(pxref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions) --).

   As convenction, the `centos-art.sh' command-line arguments have the
following format:


centos-art arg1 --arg2=val2 --arg3=val3

   In the above example, `centos-art' is the command you use to invoke
`centos-art.sh' script. The `arg1' is required and represents the
functionality you want to perform (e.g., `verify', `render', `locale',
`manual', etc.). The remaining arguments are modifiers to `arg1'. The
`--arg2' definition is required and represets, specifically, the action
inside the functionality you want to perform.  The `--arg3' and on, are
optional.

   Once command-line arguments have been retrived, the `centos-art.sh'
script loads specific functionalities using the `cli_getFunctions.sh'
function script. Only one specific functionality can be loaded at one
script execution I.e., you run `centos-art.sh' script to run just one
functionality.

   Functionalities are implemented by means of actions.  Once the
functionality has been initiazalized, actions initialization take place
for that functionality. Actions initialization model is very similar to
functions initialization model. But with the difference, that actions
are loaded inside function environment, and so, share variables and
functions defined inside function environment.

2.63 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli' Directory
===========================================

2.64 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/Functions' Directory
=====================================================

2.64.1 Goals
------------

The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions' directory exists to organize
`centos-art.sh' specific functionalities.

2.64.2 Description
------------------

The specific functions of `centos-art.sh' script are designed with
"Software Toolbox" philosophy (*note Toolbox introduction:
(coreutils.info)Toolbox introduction.) in mind: each program "should do
one thing well".  Inside `centos-art.sh' script, each specific
functionality is considered a program that should do one thing well.
Of course, if you find that they still don't do it, feel free to
improve them in order for them to do so.

   The specific functions of `centos-art.sh' script are organized
inside specific directories under `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions'
location. Each specific function directory should be named as the
function it represents, with the first letter in uppercase. For
example, if the function name is `render', the specific function
directory for it would be `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render'.

   To better understand how specific functions of `centos-art.sh'
script are designed, lets create one function which only goal is to
output different kind of greetings to your screen.

   When we create specific functions for `centos-art.sh' script it is
crucial to know what these functions will do exactly and if there is
any function that already does what we intend to do. If there is no
one, it is good time to create them then. Otherwise, if functionalities
already available don't do what you exactly expect, contact their
authors and work together to improve them.

     *Tip* Join CentOS developers mailing list <centos-art@centos.org>
     to share your ideas.

   It is also worth to know what global functions and variables do we
have available inside `centos-art.sh' script, so advantage can be taken
from them. Global variables are defined inside global function scripts.
Global functions scripts are stored immediatly under
`trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions' directory, in files begining with `cli'
prefix.

   OK, let's begin with our functionality example.

   What function name do we use? Well, lets use `greet'. Note that
`hello' word is not a verb; but an expression, a kind of greeting, an
interjection specifically. In contrast, `greet' is a verb and describes
what we do when we say `Hello!', `Hi!', and similar expressions.

   So far, we've gathered the following function information:


Name: greet
Path: trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Greet
File: trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Greet/greet.sh

   The `greet.sh' function script is the first file `centos-art.sh'
script loads when the `greet' functionality is called using commands
like `centos-art greet --hello='World''.  The `greet.sh' function
script contains the `greet' function definition.

   Inside `centos-art.sh' script, as convenction, each function script
has one top commentary, followed by one blank line, and then one
function defintion below it only.

   Inside `centos-art.sh' script functions, top commentaries have the
following components: the functionality description, one-line for
copyright note with your personal information,  the license under which
the function source code is released --the `centos-art.sh' script is
released as GPL, so do all its functions--, the `$Id$' keyword of
Subversion is later expanded by `svn propset' command.

   In our `greet' function example, top commentary for `greet.sh'
function script would look like the following:


#!/bin/bash
#
# greet.sh -- This function outputs different kind of greetings to
# your screen. Use this function to understand how centos-art.sh
# script specific functionalities work.
#

# USA.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# $Id$
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   After top commentary, separated by one blank line, the `greet'
function definition would look like the following:


function greet {

    # Define global variables.

    # Define command-line interface.
    greet_getActions

}

   The first definition inside `greet' function, are global variables
that will be available along `greet' function execution environment.
This time we didn't use global variable definitions for `greet'
function execution environment, so we left that section empty.

   Later, we call `greet_getActions' function to define the
command-line interface of `greet' functionality. The command-line
interface of `greet' functionality defines what and how actions are
performed, based on arguments combination passed to `centos-art.sh'
script.


function greet_getActions {

    case "$ACTIONNAM" in

        --hello )
            greet_doHello
            ;;

        --bye )
            greet_doBye
            ;;

        * )
            cli_printMessage "`gettext "The option provided is not valid."`"
            cli_printMessage "$(caller)" 'AsToKnowMoreLine'

    esac

}

   The ACTIONNAM global variable is defined in `cli.sh' function script
and contains the value passed before the equal sign (i.e., `=') in the
second command-line argument of `centos-art.sh' script. For example, if
the second command-line argument is `--hello='World'', the value of
ACTIONNAM variable would be `--hello'.  Using this configuration let us
deside which action to perform based on the action name passed to
`centos-art.sh' script as second argument.

   The `greet' function definition makes available two valid greetings
through `--hello' and `--bye' options.  If no one of them is provided
as second command-line argument, the `*' case is evaluated instead.

   The `*' case and its two lines further on should always be present
in `_getActions.sh' function scripts, no matter what specific
functionality you are creating. This convenction helps the user to find
out documentation about current functionality in use, when no valid
action is provided.

   The `greet_doHello' and `greet_doBye' function definitions are the
core of `greet' specific functionality.  In such function definitions
we set what our `greet' function really does: to output different kinds
of greetings.


function greet_doHello {

    cli_printMessage "`gettext "Hello"` $ACTIONVAL"

}

   The `greet_doHello' function definition is stored in
`greet_doHello.sh' function script.


function greet_doBye {

    cli_printMessage "`gettext "Goodbye"` $ACTIONVAL"

}

   The `greet_doBye' function definition is stored in the
`greet_doBye.sh' function script.

   Both `greet_doHello.sh' and `greet_doBye.sh' function scripts are
stored inside `greet' function directory path (i.e.
`trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Greet').

   The ACTIONVAL global variable is defined in `cli.sh' function script
and contains the value passed after the equal sign (i.e., `=') in the
second command-line argument of `centos-art.sh' script. For example, if
the second command-line argument is `--hello='World'', the value of
ACTIONVAL variable would be `World' without quotes.

   Let's see how `greet' specific functionality files are organzied
under `greet' function directory. To see file organization we use the
`tree' command:


trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Greet
|-- greet_doBye.sh
|-- greet_doHello.sh
|-- greet_getActions.sh
`-- greet.sh

   To try the `greet' specific functionality we've just created, pass
the function name (i.e., `greet') as first argument to `centos-art.sh'
script, and any of the valid options as second argument. Some examples
are illustrated below:


[centos@projects ~]$ centos-art greet --hello='World'
Hello World
[centos@projects ~]$ centos-art greet --bye='World'
Goodbye World
[centos@projects ~]$

   The word `World' in the examples above can be anything. In fact,
change it to have a little fun.

   Now that we have a specific function that works as we expect, it is
time to document it.  To document `greet' specific functionality, we
use its directory path and the `manual' functionality (--
*Removed*(pxref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions Manual) --) of
`centos-art.sh' script, just as the following command illustrates:


centos-art manual --edit=trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Greet

   To have a well documented function helps user to understand how your
function really works, and how it should be used.  When no valid action
is passed to a function, the `centos-art.sh' script uses the function
documentation entry as vehicle to communicate which the valid functions
are. When no documentation entry exists for a function, the
`centos-art.sh' script informs that no documentation entry exists for
such function and requests user to create it right at that time.

   Now that we have documented our function, it is time to translate its
output messages to different languages. To translate specific
functionality output messages to different languages we use the
`locale' functionality (-- *Removed*(pxref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions
Locale) --) of `centos-art.sh' script, just as the following command
illustrates:


centos-art locale --edit

     *Warning* To translate output messages in different languages,
     your system locale information --as in `LANG' environment
     variable-- must be set to that locale you want to produce
     translated messages for. For example, if you want to produce
     translated messages for Spanish language, your system locale
     information must be set to `es_ES.UTF-8', or similar, first.

   Well, it seems that our example is rather complete by now.

   In `greet' function example we've described so far, we only use
`cli_printMessage' global function in action specific function
definitions in order to print messages, but more interesting things can
be achieved inside action specific function definitions.  For example,
if you pass a directory path as action value in second argument, you
could retrive a list of files from therein, and process them. If the
list of files turns too long or you just want to control which files to
process, you could add the third argument in the form
`--filter='regex'' and reduce the amount of files to process using a
regular expression pattern.

   The `greet' function described in this section may serve you as an
introduction to understand how specific functionalities work inside
`centos-art.sh' script. With some of luck this introduction will also
serve you as motivation to create your own `centos-art.sh' script
specific functionalities.

   By the way, the `greet' functionality doesn't exist inside
`centos-art.sh' script yet. Would you like to create it?

2.64.3 Usage
------------

2.64.3.1 Global variables
.........................

The following global variables of `centos-art.sh' script, are available
for you to use inside specific functions:

 -- Variable: TEXTDOMAIN
     Default domain used to retrieve translated messages. This value is
     set in `initFunctions.sh' and shouldn't be changed.

 -- Variable: TEXTDOMAINDIR
     Default directory used to retrieve translated messages. This value
     is set in `initFunctions.sh' and shouldn't be changed.

 -- Variable: FUNCNAM
     Define function name.

     Function names associate sets of actions. There is one set of
     actions for each unique function name inside `centos-art.sh'
     script.

     Dunction names are passed as first argument in `centos-art.sh'
     command-line interface. For example, in the command `centos-art
     render --entry=path/to/dir --filter=regex', the ACTION passed to
     `centos-art.sh' script is `render'.

     When first argument is not provided, the `centos-art.sh' script
     immediatly ends its execution.

 -- Variable: FUNCDIR

 -- Variable: FUNCDIRNAME

 -- Variable: FUNCSCRIPT

 -- Variable: FUNCCONFIG

 -- Variable: ACTIONNAM
     Define action name.

     Each action name identifies an specific action to perform, inside
     an specific function.

     Action name names aare passed as second argument in
     `centos-art.sh' command-line interface. For example, in the
     command `centos-art render --entry=path/to/dir --filter=regex',
     the ACTIONNAM passed to `centos-art.sh' script is `--entry'.

     When second argument is not provided, the `centos-art.sh' script
     immediatly ends its execution.

 -- Variable: ACTIONVAL
     Define action value.

     Action values are associated to just one action name. Action values
     contain the working copy entry over which its associated action
     will be performed in.  Working copy entries can be files or
     directories inside the working copy.

 -- Variable: REGEX
     Define regular expression used as pattern to build the list of
     files to process.

     By default, REGEX variable is set to `.+' to match all files.

     Functions that need to build a list of files to process use the
     option `--filter' to redefine REGEX variable default value, and
     so, control the amount of files to process.

 -- Variable: ARGUMENTS
     Define optional arguments.

     Optional arguments, inside `centos-art.sh' script, are considered
     as all command-line arguments passed to `centos-art.sh' script,
     from third argument position on. For example, in the command
     `centos-art render --entry=path/to/dir --filter=regex' , the
     optional arguments are from `--filter=regex' argument on.

     Optional arguments are parsed using `getopt' command through the
     following base construction:


     # Define short options we want to support.
     local ARGSS=""

     # Define long options we want to support.
     local ARGSL="filter:,to:"

     # Parse arguments using getopt(1) command parser.
     cli_doParseArguments

     # Reset positional parameters using output from (getopt) argument
     # parser.
     eval set -- "$ARGUMENTS"

     # Define action to take for each option passed.
     while true; do
         case "$1" in
             --filter )
                 REGEX="$2"
                 shift 2
                 ;;
             --to )
                 TARGET="$2"
                 shift 2
                 ;;
             * )
                 break
         esac
     done

     Optional arguments provide support to command options inside
     `centos-art.sh' script. For instance, consider the Subversion
     (`svn') command, where there are many options (e.g., `copy',
     `delete', `move', etc), and inside each option there are several
     modifiers (e.g., `--revision', `--message', `--username', etc.)
     that can be combined one another in their short or long variants.

     The ARGUMENTS variable is used to store arguments passed from
     command-line for later use inside `centos-art.sh' script. Storing
     arguments is specially useful when we want to run a command with
     some specific options from them. Consider the following command:


     centos-art path --copy=SOURCE --to=TARGET --message="The commit message goes here." --username='johndoe'

     In the above command, the `--message', and `--username' options
     are specific to `svn copy' command. In such cases, options are not
     interpreted by `centos-art.sh' script itself.  Instead, the
     `centos-art.sh' script uses `getopt' to retrive them and store
     them in the ARGUMENTS variable for later use, as described in the
     following command:


     # Build subversion command to duplicate locations inside the
     # workstation.
     eval svn copy $SOURCE $TARGET --quiet $ARGUMENTS

     When `getopt' parses ARGUMENTS, we may use short options (e.g.,
     `-m') or long options (e.g., `--message'). When we use short
     options, arguments are separated by one space from the option
     (e.g., `-m 'This is a commit message.'').  When we use long
     options arguments are separated by an equal sign (`=') (e.g.,
     `--message='This is a commit message'').

     In order for `getopt' to parse ARGUMENTS correctly, it is required
     to provide the short and long definition of options that will be
     passed or at least supported by the command performing the final
     action the function script exists for.

     As convenction, inside `centos-art.sh' script, short option
     definitions are set in the ARGSS variable; and long option
     definitions are set in the ARGSL variable.

     When you define short and long options, it may be needed to define
     which of these option arguments are required and which not. To
     define an option argument as required, you need to set one colon
     `:' after the option definition (e.g., `-o m: -l message:').  On
     the other hand, to define an option argument as not required, you
     need to set two colons `::' after the option definition (e.g., `-o
     m:: -l message::').

 -- Variable: EDITOR
     Default text editor.

     The `centos-art.sh' script uses default text `EDITOR' to edit
     pre-commit subversion messages, translation files, configuration
     files, script files, and similar text-based files.

     If `EDITOR' environment variable is not set, `centos-art.sh'
     script uses `/usr/bin/vim' as default text editor. Otherwise, the
     following values are recognized by `centos-art.sh' script:

        * `/usr/bin/vim'

        * `/usr/bin/emacs'

        * `/usr/bin/nano'

     If no one of these values is set in `EDITOR' environment variable,
     `centos-art.sh' uses `/usr/bin/vim' text editor by default.

2.64.3.2 Global functions
.........................

Function scripts stored directly under `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/'
directory are used to define global functions.  Global functions can be
used inside action specific functionalities and or even be reused
inside themselves. This section provides introductory information to
global functions you can use inside `centos-art.sh' script.

 -- Function: cli_checkActionArguments
     Validate action value (ACTIONVAL) variable.

     The action value variable can take one of the following values:

       1. Path to one directory inside the local working copy,

       2. Path to one file inside the local working copy,

     If another value different from that specified above is passed to
     action value variable, the `centos-art.sh' script prints an error
     message and ends script execution.

 -- Function: cli_checkFiles FILE [TYPE]
     Verify file existence.

     `cli_checkFiles' receives a FILE absolute path and performs file
     verification as specified in TYPE.  When TYPE is not specified,
     `cli_checkFiles' verifies FILE existence, no matter what kind of
     file it be.  If TYPE is specified, use one of the following values:

    `d'
    `directory'
          Ends script execution if FILE is not a directory.

          When you verify directories with cli_checkFiles, if directory
          doesn't exist, `centos-art.sh' script asks you for
          confirmation in order to create that directory. If you answer
          positively, `centos-art.sh' script creates that directory and
          continues script flows normally. Otherwise, if you answer
          negatively, `centos-art.sh' ends script execution with an
          error and documentation message.

    `f'

    `regular-file'
          Ends script execution if FILE is not a regular file.

    `h'
    `symbolic-link'
          Ends script execution if FILE is not a symbolic link.

    `x'
    `execution'
          Ends script execution if FILE is not executable.

    `fh'
          Ends script execution if FILE is neither a regular file nor a
          symbolic link.

    `fd'
          Ends script execution if FILE is neither a regular file nor a
          directory.

    `isInWorkingCopy'
          Ends script execution if FILE is not inside the working copy.

     As default behaviour, if FILE passes all verifications,
     `centos-art.sh' script continues with its normal flow.

 -- Function: cli_commitRepoChanges [LOCATION]
     Syncronize changes between repository and working copy.

     The `cli_commitRepoChanges' function brings changes from the
     central repository down to the working copy--using `svn update'--,
     checks the working copy changes--using `svn status' command--,
     prints status report--using both `svn update' and `svn status'
     commands output, and finally, commits recent changes from the
     working copy up to the repository--using `svn commit' command--.

     Previous to commit the working copy changes up to the central
     repository, the `cli_commitRepoChanges' function asks you to
     verify changes--using `svn diff' command--, and later, another
     confirmation question is shown to be sure you really want to
     commit changes up to central repository.

     If LOCATION argument is not specified, the value of ACTIONVAL
     variable is used as reference instead.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     --> Bringing changes from the repository into the working copy
     --> Checking changes in the working copy
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Added           0 file from the repository.
     Deleted         0 file from the repository.
     Updated         0 file from the repository.
     Conflicted      0 file from the repository.
     Merged          0 file from the repository.
     Modified        4 files from the working copy.
     Unversioned     0 file from the working copy.
     Deleted         0 file from the working copy.
     Added           0 file from the working copy.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Figure 2.3: The `cli_commitRepoChanges' function output.

        Call the `cli_commitRepoChanges' function before or/and after
     calling functions that modify files or directories inside the
     working copy as you may need to.

 -- Function: cli_doParseArguments
     Redefine arguments (ARGUMENTS) global variable using `getopt'
     command output. For more information about how to use
     `cli_doParseArguments' function, see ARGUMENTS variable
     description above.

 -- Function: cli_doParseArgumentsReDef $@
     Initialize/reset arguments (ARGUMENTS) global variable using
     positional parameters variable ($@) as reference.

     When we work inside function definitions, positional parameters are
     reset to the last function definition positional parameters.  If
     you need to redefine positional parameters from one specific
     function, you need to call `cli_doParseArgumentsReDef' with the
     positional parameters variable ($@), set as first argument, to that
     specific function you want to redefine positional parameters at.

 -- Function: cli_getArguments
     Initialize function name (FUNCNAM), action name (ACTIONNAM), and
     action value (ACTIONVAL) global variables, using positional
     parameters passed in $@ variable.

     The `cli_getArguments' function is called from `cli.sh' function
     script, using `cli' function positional parameters (i.e., the
     positional parameters passed as arguments in the command-line) as
     first function argument.

     Once command-line positional parameters are accesible to
     `centos-art.sh' script execution evironment, `cli_getArguments'
     uses regular expression to retrive action variables from first and
     second argument. The first argument defines the value used as
     function name (FUNCNAM), and the second argument defines both
     values used as action name (ACTIONNAM) and action value
     (ACTIONVAL), respectively.

     The first argument is a word in lower case. This word specifies the
     name of the functionality you want to use (e.g., `render' to
     render images, `manual' to work on documentation, and so on.)

     The second argument has a long option style (e.g.,
     `--option=value'). The `--option' represents the action name
     (ACTIONNAM), and the characters inbetween the equal sign (`=') and
     the first space character, are considered as the action value
     (ACTIONVAL). In order to provide action values with space
     characters inbetween you need to enclose action value with quotes
     like in `--option='This is long value with spaces inbetween''.
     Generally, action values are used to specify paths over which the
     action name acts on.

     Once action related variables (i.e., FUNCNAM, ACTIONNAM, and
     ACTIONVAL) are defined and validated, `cli_getArguments' shifts
     the positional arguments to remove the first two arguments passed
     (i.e., those used to retrive action related variables) and
     redefine the arguments (ARGUMENTS) global variable with the new
     positional parameters information.

 -- Function: cli_getFunctions
     Initialize funtionalities supported by `centos-art.sh' script.

     Functionalities supported by `centos-art.sh' script are organized
     in functionality directories under `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/'
     directory. Each functionality directory stores function scripts to
     the functionality such directory was created for. Function scripts
     contain function definitions.  Function definitions contain
     several commands focused on achieving one specific task only
     (i.e., the one such functionality was created for).

     In order for `centos-art.sh' script to recognize a functionality,
     such functionality needs to be stored under
     `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/' in a directory written capitalized
     (i.e., the whole name is written in lowercase except the first
     character which is in uppercase). The directory where one specific
     functionality is stored is known as the `functionality directory'.

     Inside each functionality directory, the functionalty itself is
     implemented through function scripts. Function scripts are
     organized in files independently one another and written in
     `camelCase' format with the function name as prefix.  Separation
     between prefix and description is done using underscore (`_')
     character.

     In order for `centos-art.sh' script to load functionalities
     correctly, function definition inside function scripts should be
     set using the `function' reserved word, just as in the following
     example:


     function prefix_doSomething {

         # Do something here...

     }

     The above function definition is just a convenction we use, in
     order to make identification of function names easier read and
     automate by `centos-art.sh' script initialization commands, once
     `centos-art.sh' script determines which functionality directory to
     use.  Specifically, in order to initialize and export functions,
     `centos-art.sh' script executes all function scripts inside the
     functionality directory, and later `grep' on them using a regular
     expression pattern, where the `function' reserved word is used as
     reference to retrive the function names and export them to
     `centos-art.sh' script execution environment, and so, make
     function definitions --from function scripts inside the
     functionality directory-- available for further calls.

     If the functionality specified in the command-line first argument
     doesn't have a functionality directory, `centos-art.sh' script
     considers the functionality provided in the command-line as invalid
     functionality and immediatly stops script execution with an error
     message.

     In order to keep visual consistency among function scripts, please
     consider using the following function script design model as
     template for your own function scripts:


     #!/bin/bash
     #
     # prefix_doSomething.sh -- This function illustrates function scripts
     # design model you can use to create your own function scripts inside
     # centos-art.sh script.

     function prefix_doSomething {

         # Do something here...

     }

 -- Function: cli_getCountryCodes [FILTER]
     Output country codes supported by `centos-art.sh' script.

     The `cli_getCountryCodes' function outputs a list with country
     codes as defined in ISO3166 standard. When FILTER is provided,
     `cli_getCountryCodes' outputs country codes that match FILTER
     regular expression pattern.

 -- Function: cli_getCountryName [FILTER]
     Outputs country name supported by `centos-art.sh' script.

     The `cli_getCountryName' function reads one language locale code
     in the format LL_CC and outputs the name of its related country as
     in ISO3166. If filter is specified, `cli_getCountryName' returns
     the country name that matches the locale code specified in FILTER,
     exactly.

 -- Function: cli_getCurrentLocale
     Output current locale used by `centos-art.sh' script.

     The `cli_getCurrentLocale' function uses `LANG' environment
     variable to build a locale pattern that is later applied to
     `cli_getLocales' function output in order to return the current
     locale that `centos-art.sh' script works with.

     The current locale information, returned by
     `cli_getCurrentLocale', is output from more specific to less
     specific. For example, if `en_GB' locale exists in
     `cli_getLocales' function output, the `en_GB' locale would take
     precedence before `en' locale.

     Locale precedence selection is quite important in order to define
     the locale type we use for message translations. For example, if
     `en_GB' is used, we are also saying that the common language
     specification for English language (i.e., `en') is no longer used.
     Instead, we are using English non-common country-specific language
     specifications like `en_AU', `en_BW', `en_GB', `en_US', etc., for
     message translations.

     Use `cli_getCurrentLocale' function to know what current locale
     information to use inside `centos-art.sh' script.

 -- Function: cli_getFilesList [LOCATION]
     Output list of files to process.

     The `cli_getFilesList' function uses LOCATION variable as source
     location to build a list of files just as specified by regular
     expression (REGEX) global variable. Essentially, what the
     `cli_getFilesList' function does is using `find' command to look
     for files in the location (LOCATION) just as posix-egrep regular
     expression (REGEX) specifies.

     If LOCATION is not specified when `cli_getFilesList' function is
     called, the action value (ACTIONVAL) global variable is used as
     location value instead.

     By default, if the regular expression (REGEX) global variable is
     not redefined after its first definition in the `cli' function,
     all files that match default regular expression value (i.e., `.+')
     will be added to the list of files to process. Otherwise, if you
     redefine the regular expression global variable after its first
     definition in the `cli' function and before calling
     `cli_getFilesList' function, the last value you specifed is used
     instead.

     When you need to customize the regular expression (REGEX) global
     variable value inside a function, do not redefine the global
     variable (at least you be absolutly convinced you need to).
     Instead, set the regular expression global variable as `local' to
     the function you need a customized regular expression value for.
     If we don't redefine the regular expression global variable as
     local to the function, or use another name for the regular
     expression variable (which is not very convenient in order to keep
     the amount of names to remember low), you may experiment undesired
     concantenation issues that make your regular expression to be
     something different from that you expect them to be, specially if
     the function where you are doing the variable redefinition is
     called several times during the same script execution.

     As result, the `cli_getFilesList' re-defines the value of FILES
     variable with the list of files the `find' command returned. As
     example, consider the following construction:


     function prefix_doSomething {

         # Initialize the list of files to process.
         local FILES=''

         # Initialize location.
         local LOCATION=/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Themes/Models/Default

         # Re-define regular expression to match scalable vector graphic
         # files only. Note how we use the global value of REGEX to build a
         # new local REGEX value here.
         local REGEX="${REGEX}.*\.(svgz|svg)"

         # Redefine list of files to process.
         cli_getFilesList $LOCATION

         # Process list of files.
         for FILE in $FILES;do
             cli_printMessages "$FILE" 'AsResponseLine'
             # Do something else here on...
         done

     }


 -- Function: cli_getLangCodes [FILTER]
     Outputs language codes supported by `centos-art.sh' script.

     `cli_getLangCodes' function outputs a list of language codes as
     defined in ISO639 standard. When FILTER is provided,
     `cli_getLangCodes' outputs language codes that match FILTER
     regular expression pattern.

 -- Function: cli_getLangName [FILTER]
     Outputs language names supported by `centos-art.sh' script.

     `cli_getLangName' function reads one language locale code in the
     format LL_CC and outputs the language related name as in ISO639. If
     filter is specified, `cli_getLangName' returns the language name
     that matches the locale code specified in FILTER, exactly.

 -- Function: cli_getLocales
     Output locale codes supported by `centos-art.sh' script.

     Occasionally, you use `cli_getLocales' function to add locale
     information in non-common country-specific language (`LL_CC')
     format for those languages (e.g., `bn_IN', `pt_BR', etc.)  which
     locale differences cannot be solved using common language
     specifications (`LL') into one unique common locale specification
     (e.g., `bn', `pt', etc.).

 -- Function: cli_getRepoName NAME TYPE
     Sanitate file names.

     Inside `centos-art.sh' script, specific functionalities rely both
     in `cli_getRepoName' and repository file system organization to
     achieve their goals.  Consider `cli_getRepoName' function as
     central place to manage file name convenctions for other functions
     inside `centos-art.sh' script.

          *Important* `cli_getRepoName' function doesn't verify file or
          directory existence, for that purpose use `cli_checkFiles'
          function instead.

     The NAME variable contains the file name or directory name you
     want to sanitate.

     The TYPE variable specifies what type of sanitation you want to
     perform on NAME. The TYPE can be one of the following values:

    `d'
    `directory'
          Sanitate directory NAMEs.

    `f'

    `regular-file'
          Sanitate regular file NAMEs.

     Use `cli_getRepoName' function to sanitate file names and
     directory names before their utilization.

     Use `cli_getRepoName' when you need to change file name
     convenctions inside `centos-art.sh' script.

     When we change file name convenctions inside `cli_getRepoName'
     what we are really changing is the way functions interpret
     repository file system organization. Notice that when we change a
     file name (e.g., a function name), it is necessary to update all
     files where such file name is placed on. This may require a
     massive substitution inside the repository, each time we change
     name convenctions in the repository (-- *Removed*(pxref:trunk
     Scripts Bash Functions Path) --, for more information).

 -- Function: cli_getRepoStatus [LOCATION]
     Request repository status.

     This function requests the status of a LOCATION inside the working
     copy using the `svn status' command and returns the first
     character in the output line, just as described in `svn help
     status'. If LOCATION is not a regular file or a directory, inside
     the working copy, the `centos-art.sh' script prints a message and
     ends its execution.

     Use this function to perform verifications based a repository
     LOCATION status.

 -- Function: cli_getTemporalFile NAME
     Output absolute path to temporal file NAME.

     The `cli_getTemporalFile' function uses `/tmp' directory as source
     location to store temporal files, the `centos-art.sh' script name,
     and a random identification string to let you run more than one
     `centos-art.sh' script simultaneously on the same user session.
     For example, due the following temporal file defintion:


     cli_getTemporalFile $FILE

     If FILE name is `instance.svg' and the unique random string is
     `f16f7b51-ac12-4b7f-9e66-72df847f12de', the final temporal file,
     built from previous temporal file definition, would be:


     /tmp/centos-art.sh-f16f7b51-ac12-4b7f-9e66-72df847f12de-instance.svg

     When you use the `cli_getTemporalFile' function to create temporal
     files, be sure to remove temporal files created once you've ended
     up with them.  For example, consider the following construction:


     for FILE in $FILES;do

         # Initialize temporal instance of file.
         INSTANCE=$(cli_getTemporalFile $FILE)

         # Do something ...

         # Remove temporal instance of file.
         if [[ -f $INSTANCE ]];then
             rm $INSTANCE
         fi

     done

     Use the `cli_getTemporalFile' function whenever you need to create
     temporal files inside `centos-art.sh' script.

 -- Function: cli_getThemeName
     Output theme name.

     In order for `cli_getThemeName' function to extract theme name
     correctly, the ACTIONVAL variable must contain a directory path
     under `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/' directory structure.
     Otherwise, `cli_getThemeName' returns an empty string.

 -- Function: cli_printMessage MESSAGE [FORMAT]
     Define standard output message definition supported by
     `centos-art.sh' script.

     When FORMAT is not specified, `cli_printMessage' outputs
     information just as it was passed in MESSAGE variable.  Otherwise,
     FORMAT can take one of the following values:

    `AsHeadingLine'
          To print heading messages.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          $MESSAGE
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    `AsWarningLine'
          To print warning messages.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          WARNING: $MESSAGE
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    `AsNoteLine'
          To print note messages.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          NOTE: $MESSAGE
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    `AsUpdatingLine'
          To print `Updating' messages on two-columns format.

          To print `Removing' messages on two-columns format.
          Removing        $MESSAGE

    `AsCheckingLine'
          To print `Checking' messages on two-columns format.
          Checking        $MESSAGE

    `AsCreatingLine'
          To print `Creating' messages on two-columns format.
          Creating        $MESSAGE

    `AsSavedAsLine'
          To print `Saved as' messages on two-columns format.
          Saved as        $MESSAGE

    `AsLinkToLine'
          To print `Linked to' messages on two-columns format.
          Linked to       $MESSAGE

    `AsMovedToLine'
          To print `Moved to' messages on two-columns format.
          Moved to        $MESSAGE

    `AsTranslationLine'
          To print `Translation' messages on two-columns format.
          Translation     $MESSAGE

    `AsConfigurationLine'
          To print `Configuration' messages on two-columns format.
          Configuration   $MESSAGE

    `AsResponseLine'
          To print response messages on one-column format.
          --> $MESSAGE

    `AsRequestLine'
          To print request messages on one-column format. Request
          messages output messages with one colon (`:') and without
          trailing newline (`\n') at message end.
          $MESSAGE:

    `AsYesOrNoRequestLine'
          To print `yes or no' request messages on one-column format. If
          something different from `y' is answered (when using
          `en_US.UTF-8' locale), script execution ends immediatly.


          $MESSAGE [y/N]:

          When we use `centos-art.sh' script in a locale different from
          `en_US.UTF-8', confirmation answer may be different from `y'.
          For example, if you use `es_ES.UTF-8' locale, the
          confirmation question would look like:


          $MESSAGE [s/N]:

          and the confirmation answer would be `s', as it is on Spanish
          `sí' word.

          Definition of which confirmation word to use is set on
          translation messages for your specific locale information. --
          *Removed*(xref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions Locale) --, for
          more information about locale-specific translation messages.

    `AsToKnowMoreLine'
          To standardize `to know more, run the following command:'
          messages. When the `AsToKnowMoreLine' option is used, the
          MESSAGE value should be set to `"$(caller)"'. `caller' is a
          Bash builtin that returns the context of the current
          subroutine call. `AsToKnowMoreLine' option uses `caller'
          builtin output to build documentation entries dynamically.


          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          To know more, run the following command:
          centos-art manual --read='path/to/dir'
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          Use `AsToKnowMoreLine' option after errors and for intentional
          script termination.

    `AsRegularLine'
          To standardize regular messages on one-column format.

          When MESSAGE contains a colon inside (e.g., `description:
          message'), the `cli_printMessage' function outputs MESSAGE on
          two-columns format.

     Use `cli_printMessage' function whenever you need to output
     information from `centos-art.sh' script.

          *Tip* To improve two-columns format, change the following
          file:
          trunk/Scripts/Bash/Styles/output_forTwoColumns.awk

2.68.2 Description
------------------

This command looks for `.sh' files inside Bash directory and extracts
translatable strings from files, using `xgettext' command, in order to
create a portable object template (`centos-art.sh.pot') file for them.

   With the `centos-art.sh.pot' file up to date, the `centos-art'
command removes the temporal list of files sotred inside `/tmp'
directory and checks the current language of your user's session to
create a portable object file for it, in the location
`$CLI_LANG/$CLI_LANG.po'.

   The CLI_LANG variable discribes the locale language used to output
messages inside `centos-art' command. The locale language used inside
`centos-art' command is taken from the `LANG' environment variable.
The CLI_LANG variable has the `LL_CC' format, where `LL' is a language
code from the ISO-639 standard, and `CC' a country code from the
ISO-3166 standard.

   The `LANG' environment variable is set when you do log in to your
system. If you are using a graphical session, change language to your
native language and do login. That would set and exoprt the `LANG'
environment variable to the correct value. On the other side, if you
are using a text session edit your `~/.bash_profile' file to set and
export the `LANG' environment variable to your native locale as defines
the `locale -a' command output; do logout, and do login again.

   At this point, the `LANG' environment variable has the appropriate
value you need, in order to translate `centos-art.sh' messages to your
native language (the one set in `LANG' environment variable).

   With the `$CLI_LANG/$CLI_LANG.po' file up to date, the `centos-art'
opens it for you to update translation strings.  The `centos-art'
command uses the value of EDITOR environment variable to determine your
favorite text editor. If no value is defined on EDITOR, the
`/usr/bin/vim' text editor is used as default.

   When you finishd PO file edition and quit text editor, the
`centos-art' command creates the related machine object in the location
`$CLI_LANG/LC_MESSAGES/$TEXTDOMAIN.mo'.

   At this point, all translations you made in the PO file should be
available to your language when runing `centos-art.sh' script.

   In order to make the `centos-art.sh' internationalization, the
`centos-art.sh' script was modified as described in the `gettext' info
documentation (`info gettext').  You can find such modifications in the
following files:

   * `trunk/Scripts/Bash/initFunctions.sh'

   * `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Help/cli_localeMessages.sh'

   * `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Help/cli_localeMessagesStatus.sh'

   * ...

2.68.3 Usage
------------

`centos-art locale --edit'
     Use this command to translate command-line interface output
     messages in the current system locale you are using (as specified
     in `LANG' environment variable).

`centos-art locale --list'
     Use this command to see the command-line interface locale report.

inside the repository.

2.70.2 Description
------------------

_"CentOS like trees, has roots, trunk, branches, leaves and flowers.
Day by day they work together in freedom, ruled by the laws of nature
and open standards, to show the beauty of its existence."_

2.70.2.1 Repository layout
..........................

The repository layout describes organization of files and directories
inside the repository. The repository layout provides the standard
backend required for automation scripts to work correctly. If such
layout changes unexpectedly, automation scripts may confuse themselves
and stop doing what we expect from them to do.

   As convenction, inside CentOS Artwork Repository, we organize files
and directories related to CentOS corporate visual identity under three
top level directories named: `trunk/', `branches/', and `tags/'.

   The `trunk/' directory (*note Filesystem trunk::) organizes the main
development line of CentOS corporate visual identity. Inside `trunk/'
directory structure, the CentOS corporate visual identity concepts are
implemented using directories.  There is one directory level for each
relevant concept inside the repository. The `trunk/' directory
structure is mainly used to perform development tasks related to CentOS
corporate visual identity.

   The `branches/' directory () oranizes parallel development lines to
`trunk/' directory. The `branches/' directory is used to set points in
time where develpment lines are devided one from another taking separte
and idependent lives that share a common past from the point they were
devided on. The `branches/' directory is mainly used to perform quality
assurance tasks related to CentOS corporate visual identity.

   The `tags/' directory (*note Filesystem tags::) organizes parallel
frozen lines to `branches/' directory.  The parallel frozen lines are
immutable, nothing change inside them once they has been created.  The
`tags/' directory is mainly used to publish final releases of CentOS
corporate visual identity.

   The CentOS Artwork Repository layout is firmly grounded on a
Subversion base.  Subversion (`http://subversion.tigris.org') is a
version control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files
and directories (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  Subversion keeps a
single copy of the master sources.  This copy  is called the source
"repository"; it contains all the information to permit extracting
previous versions of those files at any time.

2.70.2.2 Repository name convenctions
.....................................

Repository name convenctions help us to maintain consistency of names
inside the repository.

   Repository name convenctions are applied to files and directories
inside the repository layout. As convenction, inside the repository
layout, file names are all written in lowercase (`01-welcome.png',
`splash.png', `anaconda_header.png', etc.) and directory names are all
written capitalized (e.g., `Identity', `Themes', `Motifs', `TreeFlower',
etc.).

   Repository name convenctions are implemented inside the
`cli_getRepoName' function of `centos-art.sh' script. With
`cli_getRepoName' function we reduce the amount of commands and
convenctions to remember, concentrating them in just one single place
to look for fixes and improvements.

2.70.2.3 Repository work flow
.............................

Repository work flow describes the steps and time intervals used to
produce CentOS corporate visual identity inside CentOS Artwork
Repository.

   To illustrate repository work flow let's consider themes' development
cycle.

   Initially, we start working themes on their trunk development line
(e.g., `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/'), here we organize
information that cannot be produced automatically (i.e., background
images, concepts, color information, screenshots, etc.).

   Later, when theme trunk development line is considered "ready" for
implementation (e.g.,  all required backgrounds have been designed), we
create a branch for it (e.g.,
`branches/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/1/').  Once the branch has
been created, we forget that branch and continue working the trunk
development line while others (e.g., an artwork quality assurance team)
test the new branch for tunning it up.

   Once the branch has been tunned up, and considered "ready" for
release, it is freezed under `tags/' directory (e.g.,
`tags/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFower/1.0/') for packagers,
webmasters, promoters, and anyone who needs images from that CentOS
theme the tag was created for.

   Both branches and tags, inside CentOS Artwork Repository, use
numerical values to identify themselves under the same location.
Branches start at one (i.e., `1') and increment one unit for each
branch created from the same trunk development line.  Tags start at
zero (i.e., `0') and increment one unit for each tag created from the
same branch development line.

     *Convenction* Do not freeze trunk development lines using tags
     directly.  If you think you need to freeze a trunk development
     line, create a branch for it and then freeze that branch instead.

   The trunk development line may introduce problems we cannot see
immediatly. Certainly, the high changable nature of trunk development
line complicates finding and fixing such problems. On the other hand,
the branched development lines provide a more predictable area where
only fixes/corrections to current content are commited up to repository.

   If others find and fix bugs inside the branched development line, we
could merge such changes/experiences back to trunk development line
(not visversa) in order for future branches, created from trunk, to
benefit.

   Time intervals used to create branches and tags may vary, just as
different needs may arrive. For example, consider the release schema of
CentOS distribution: one major release every 2 years, security updates
every 6 months, support for 7 years long. Each time a CentOS
distribution is released, specially if it is a major release, there is
a theme need in order to cover CentOS distribution artwork
requirements. At this point, is where CentOS Artwork Repository comes
up to scene.

   Before releasing a new major release of CentOS distribution we create
a branch for one of several theme development lines available inside
the CentOS Artwork Repository, perform quality assurance on it, and
later, freeze that branch using tags. Once a the theme branch has been
frozen (under `tags/' directory), CentOS Packagers (the persons whom
build CentOS distribution) can use that frozen branch as source
location to fulfill CentOS distribution artwork needs. The same applies
to CentOS Webmasters (the persons whom build CentOS websites), and any
other visual manifestation required by the project.

2.70.2.4 Parallel directories
.............................

Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, parallel directories are simple
directory entries built from a common parent directory and placed in a
location different to that, the common parent directory is placed on.
Parallel directories are useful to create branches, tags, translations,
documentation, pre-rendering configuration script, and similar
directory structures.

   Parallel directories take their structure from one unique parent
directory. Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, this unique parent
directory is under `trunk/Identity' location.  The `trunk/Identity'
location must be considered the reference for whatever information you
plan to create inside the repository.

   In some circumstances, parallel directories may be created removing
uncommon information from their paths. Uncommon path information refers
to those directory levels in the path which are not common for other
parallel directories.  For example, when rendering
`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro' directory structure,
the `centos-art.sh' script removes the `Motifs/TreeFlower/' directory
levels from path, in order to build the parallel directory used to
retrived translations, and pre-rendering configuration scripts required
by `render' functionality.

   Another example of parallel directory is the documentation structure
created by `manual' functionality. This time, `centos-art.sh' script
uses parallel directory information with uncommon directory levels to
build the documentation entry required by Texinfo documentation system,
inside the repository.

   Othertimes, parallel directories may add uncommon information to
their paths. This is the case we use to create branches and tags. When
we create branches and tags, a numerical identifier is added to parallel
directory structure path. The place where the numerical identifier is
set on is relevant to corporate visual identity structure and should be
carefully considered where it will be.

   When one parent directory changes, all their related parallel
directories need to be changed too. This is required in order for
parallel directories to retain their relation with the parent directory
structure.  In the other hand, parallel directories should never be
modified under no reason but to satisfy the relation to their parent
directory structure.  Liberal change of parallel directories may
suppresses the conceptual idea they were initially created for; and
certainly, things may stop working the way they should do.

2.70.2.5 Syncronizing path information
......................................

Parallel directories are very useful to keep repository organized but
introduce some complications.  For instance, consider what would happen
to functionalities like `manual' (`trunk Scripts Bash Functions
Manual') that rely on parent directory structures to create
documentation entries (using parallel directory structures) if one of
those parent directory structures suddenly changes after the
documentation entry has been already created for it?

   In such cases, functionalities like `manual' may confuse themselves
if path information is not updated to reflect the relation with its
parent directory.  Such functionalities work with parent directory
structure as reference; if a parent directory changes, the
functionalities dont't even note it because they work with the last
parent directory structure available in the repository, no matter what
it is.

   In the specific case of documentation (the `manual' functionality),
the problem mentioned above provokes that older parent directories,
already documented, remain inside documentation directory structures as
long as you get your hands into the documentation directory structure
(`trunk/Manuals') and change what must be changed to match the new
parent directory structure.

   There is no immediate way for `manual', and similar functionalities
that use parent directories as reference, to know when and how
directory movements take place inside the repository. Such information
is available only when the file movement itself takes place inside the
repository. So, is there, at the moment of moving files, when we need
to syncronize parallel directories with their unique parent directory
structure.

     *Warning* There is not support for URL reference inside
     `centos-art.sh' script.  The `centos-art.sh' script is designed to
     work with local files inside the working copy only.

   As CentOS Artwork Repository is built over a version control system,
file movements inside the repository are considered repository changes.
In order for these repository changes to be versioned, we need to,
firstly, add changes into the version control system, commit them, and
later, perform movement actions using version control system commands.
This configuration makes possible for everyone to know about changes
details inside the repository; and if needed, revert or update them
back to a previous revision.

   Finally, once all path information has been corrected, it is time to
take care of information inside the files. For instance, considere what
would happen if you make a reference to a documentation node, and later
the documentation node you refere to is deleted. That would make
Texinfo to produce error messages at export time. So, the
`centos-art.sh' script needs to know when such changes happen, in a way
they could be noted and handled without producing errors.

2.70.2.6 What is the right place to store it?
.............................................

Occasionly, you may find that new corporate visual identity components
need to be added to the repository. If that is your case, the first
question you need to ask yourself, before start to create directories
blindly all over, is: What is the right place to store it?

   The CentOS Community different free support vains (see:
`http://wiki.centos.org/GettingHelp') are the best place to find
answers to your question, but going there with hands empty is not good
idea. It may give the impression you don't really care about. Instead,
consider the following suggestions to find your own comprehension and
so, make your propositions based on it.

   When we are looking for the correct place to store new files, to bear
in mind the corporate visual identity structure used inside the CentOS
Artwork Repository (*note Filesystem trunk Identity::) would be probaly
the best advice we could offer, the rest is just matter of choosing
appropriate names.  To illustrate this desition process let's consider
the `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower' directory as example.  It
is the trunk development line of _TreeFlower_ artistic motif.  Artistic
motifs are considered part of themes, which in turn are considered part
of CentOS corporate visual identity.

   When building parent directory structures, you may find that reaching
an acceptable location may take some time, and as it uses to happen
most of time; once you've find it, that may be not a definite solution.
There are many concepts that you need to play with, in order to find a
result that match the conceptual idea you try to implement in the new
directory location. To know which these concepts are, split the
location in words and read its documentation entry from less specific
to more specific.

   For example, the `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower' location
evolved through several months of contant work and there is no certain
it won't change in the future, even it fixes quite well the concept we
are trying to implement.  The concepts used in
`trunk/Identity/Themes/Distro/Motifs/TreeFlower' location are described
in the following commands, respectively:


centos-art manual --read=turnk/
centos-art manual --read=turnk/Identity/
centos-art manual --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/
centos-art manual --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/
centos-art manual --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/

   Other location concepts can be found similary as we did above, just
change the location we used above by the one you are trying to know
concepts for.

2.70.3 Usage
------------

`centos-art path --copy='SRC' --to='DST''
     Copy `SRC' to `DST' and schedule `DST' for addition (with
     history).  In this command, `SRC' and `DST' are both working copy
     (WC) entries.

`centos-art path --delete='SRC''
     Delete `DST'. In order for this command to work the file or
     directory you intend to delete should be under version control
     first.  In this command, `SRC' is a working copy (WC) entry.

2.71 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/Functions/Render' Directory
============================================================

The `render' functionality exists to produce both identity and
translation files on different levels of information (i.e., different
languages, release numbers, architectures, etc.).

   The `render' functionality relies on "renderable directory
structures" to produce files. Renderable directory structures can be
either "identity directory structures" or "translation directory
structures" with special directories inside.

2.71.1 Renderable identity directory structures
-----------------------------------------------

Renderable identity directory structures are the starting point of
identity rendition. Whenever we want to render a component of CentOS
corporate visual identity, we need to point `centos-art.sh' to a
renderable identity directory structure. If such renderable identity
directory structure doesn't exist, then it is good time to create it.

   Inside the working copy, one renderable identity directory structures
represents one visual manifestation of CentOS corporate visual
identity, or said differently, each visual manifestation of CentOS
corporate visual identity should have one renderable identity directory
structure.

   Inside renderable identity directory structures, `centos-art.sh' can
render both image-based and text-based files. Specification of whether
a renderable identity directory structure produces image-based or
text-based content is a configuration action that takes place in the
pre-rendition configuration script of that renderable identity
directory structure.

   Inside renderable identity directory structures, content production
is organized in different configurations. A content production
configuration is a unique combination of the components that make an
identity directory structure renderable. One content production
configuration does one thing only (e.g., to produce untranslated
images), but it can be extended (e.g., adding translation files) to
achieve different needs (e.g., to produce translated images).

2.71.1.1 Design template without translation
............................................

The design template without translation configuration is based on a
renderable identity directory structure with an empty translation
directory structure. In this configuration, one design template
produces one untranslated file. Both design templates and final
untranslated files share the same file name, but they differ one
another in file-type and file-extension.

   For example, to produce images without translations (there is no much
use in producing text-based files without translations), consider the
following configuration:

*One renderable identity directory structure:*
     In this example we used `Identity/Path/To/Dir' as the identity
     component we want to produce untranslated images for.  Identity
     components can be either under `trunk/' or `branches/' directory
     structure.

     The identity component (i.e., `Identity/Path/To/Dir', in this
     case) is also the bond component we use to connect the identity
     directory structures with their respective auxiliar directories
     (i.e., translation directory structres and pre-rendition
     configuration structures).  The bond component is the path
     convenction that `centos-art.sh' uses to know where to look for
     related translations, configuration scripts and whatever auxiliar
     thing a renderable directory structure may need to have.


           | The bond component
           |----------------->|
     trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir  <-- Renderable identity directory structure.
     |-- Tpl                     <-- Design template directory.
     |   `-- file.svg            <-- Design template file.
     `-- Img                     <-- Directory used to store final files.
         `-- file.png            <-- Final image-based file produced from
                                     design template file.

     Inside design template directory, design template files are based
     on SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and use the extension `.svg'.
     Design template files can be organized using several directory
     levels to create a simple but extensible configuration, specially
     if translated images are not required.

     In order for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files to be considered
     "design template" files, they should be placed under the design
     template directory and to have set a `CENTOSARTWORK' object id
     inside.

     The `CENTOSARTWORK' word itself is a convenction name we use to
     define which object/design area, inside a design template, the
     `centos-art.sh' script will use to export as PNG (Portable Network
     Graphic) image at rendition time.  Whithout such object id
     specification, the `centos-art.sh' script cannot know what
     object/design area you (as designer) want to export as PNG
     (Portable Network Graphic) image file.

          *Note* At rendition time, the content of `Img/' directory
          structure is produced by `centos-art.sh' automatically.

     When a renderable identity directory structure is configured to
     produce image-based content, `centos-art.sh' produces PNG
     (Portable Network Graphics) files with the `.png' extension. Once
     the base image format has been produced, it is possible for
     `centos-art.sh' to use it in order to automatically create other
     image formats that may be needed (-- *Removed*(pxref:trunk Scripts
     Bash Functions Render Config) --).

     Inside the working copy, you can find an example of "design
     template without translation" configuration at
     `trunk/Identity/Models/'.

     *Note Filesystem trunk Identity::, for more information.

*One translation directory structure:*
     In order for an identity entry to be considered an identity
     renderable directory structure, it should have a translation
     entry. The content of the translation entry is relevant to
     determine how to process the identity renderable directory entry.

     If the translation entry is empty (i.e., there is no file inside
     it), `centos-art.sh' interprets the identity renderable directory
     structure as a "design templates without translation"
     configuration.


                        | The bond component
                        |----------------->|
     trunk/Translations/Identity/Path/To/Dir
     `-- (empty)

     If the translation entry is not empty, `centos-art.sh' can
     interpret the identity renderable directory structure as one of the
     following configurations: "design template with translation
     (one-to-one)" or "design template with translation (optimized)".
     Which one of these configurations is used depends on the value
     assigned to the matching list (MATCHINGLIST) variable in the
     pre-rendition configuration script of the renderable identity
     directory structure we are producing images for.

     If the matching list variable is empty (as it is by default), then
     "design template with translation (one-to-one)" configuration is
     used. In this configuration it is required that both design
     templates and translation files have the same file names. This
     way, _one_ translation files is applied to _one_ design template,
     to produce _one_ translated image.

     If the matching list variable is not empty (because you redefine
     it in the pre-rendition configuration script), then "design
     template with translation (optimized)" configuration is used
     instead. In this configuration, design templates and translation
     files don't need to have the same names since such name
     relationship between them is specified in the matching list
     properly.

     -- *Removed*(xref:trunk Translations) --, for more information.

*One pre-rendition configuration script:*
     In order to make an identity directory structure renderable, a
     pre-rendition configuration script should exist for it.  The
     pre-rendition configuration script specifies what type of rendition
     does `centos-art.sh' will perform over the identity directory
     structure and how does it do that.


                                                | The bond component
                                                |----------------->|
     trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Path/To/Dir
     `-- render.conf.sh

     In this configuration the pre-rendition configuration script
     (`render.conf.sh') would look like the following:


     function render_loadConfig {

         # Define rendition actions.
         ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'

     }

     Since translation directory structure is empty, `centos-art.sh'
     assumes a "design template without translation" configuration to
     produce untranslated images.

     To produce untranslated images, `centos-art.sh' takes one design
     template and creates one temporal instance from it.  Later,
     `centos-art.sh' uses the temporal design template instance as
     source file to export the final untranslated image. The action of
     exporting images from SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to PNG
     (Portable Network Graphics) is possible thanks to Inkscape's
     command-line interface and the `CENTOSARTWORK' object id we
     previously set inside design templates.

     3 | Remove design template instance.

     Finally, when the untranslated image has been created, the temporal
     design template instance is removed. At this point,
     `centos-art.sh' takes the next design template and repeats the
     whole production flow once again (design template by design
     template), until all design templates be processed.

     -- *Removed*(xref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions Render Config) --,
     for more information.

2.71.1.2 Design template with translation (one-to-one)
......................................................

Producing untranslated images is fine in many cases, but not always.
Sometimes it is required to produce images in different languages and
that is something that untrasnlated image production cannot achieve.
However, if we fill its empty translation entry with translation files
(one for each design template) we extend the production flow from
untranslated image production to translated image production.

   In order for `centos-art.sh' to produce images correctly, each
design template should have one translation file and each translation
file should have one design template.  Otherwise, if there is a missing
design template or a missing translation file, `centos-art.sh' will not
produce the final image related to the missing component.

   In order for `centos-art.sh' to know which is the relation between
translation files and design templates the translation directory
structure is taken as reference.  For example, the
`trunk/Translations/Identity/Path/To/Dir/file.sed' translation file
does match `trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir/Tpl/file.svg' design template,
but it doesn't match `trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir/File.svg' or
`trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir/Tpl/File.svg' or
`trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir/Tpl/SubDir/file.svg' design templates.

   The pre-rendition configuration script used to produce untranslated
images is the same we use to produce translated images. There is no
need to modify it. So, as we are using the same pre-rendition
configuration script, we can say that translated image production is
somehow an extended/improved version of untranslated image production.

     *Note* If we use no translation file in the translation entry
     (i.e., an empty directory), `centos-art.sh' assumes the
     untranslated image production. If we fill the translation entry
     with translation files, `centos-art.sh' assumes the translated
     image production.

   To produce final images, `centos-art.sh' applies one translation
file to one design template and produce a translated design template
instance. Later, `centos-art.sh' uses the translated template instance
to produce the translated image. Finally, when the translated image has
been produced, `centos-art.sh' removes the translated design template
instance. This production flow is repeated for each translation file
available in the translatio entry.

2.71.1.3 Design template with translation (optimized)
.....................................................

Producing translated images satisfies almost all our production images
needs, but there is still a pitfall in them. In order to produce
translated images as in the "one-to-one" configuration describes
previously, it is required that one translation file has one design
template. That's useful in many cases, but what would happen if we need
to apply many different translation files to the same design template?
Should we have to duplicate the same design template file for each
translation file, in order to satisfy the "one-to-one" relation? What
if we need to assign translation files to design templates arbitrarily?

   Certenly, that's something the "one-to-one" configuration cannot
handle.  So, that's why we had to "optimize" it. The optimized
configuration consists on using a matching list (MATCHINGLIST) variable
that specifies the relationship between translation files and design
templates in an arbitrary way. Using such matching list between
translation files and design templates let us use as many assignment
combinations as translation files and design templates we are working
with.

   The MATCHINGLIST variable is set in the pre-rendition configuration
script of the component we want to produce images for.  By default, the
MATCHINGLIST variable is empty which means no matching list is used.
Otherwise, if MATCHINGLIST variable has a value different to empty
value then, `centos-art.sh' interprets the matching list in order to
know how translation files are applied to design templates.

   For example, consider the following configuration:

*One entry under `trunk/Identity/':*
     In this configuration we want to produce three images using a
     paragraph-based style, controlled by `paragraph.svg' design
     template; and one image using a list-based style, controlled by
     `list.svg' design template.


     trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir
     |-- Tpl
     |   |-- paragraph.svg
     |   `-- list.svg
     `-- Img
         |-- 01-welcome.png
         |-- 02-donate.png
         |-- 03-docs.png
         `-- 04-support.png

*One entry under `trunk/Translations/':*
     In order to produce translated images we need to have one
     translation file for each translated image we want to produce.
     Notice how translation names do match final image file names, but
     how translation names do not match design template names. When we
     use matching list there is no need for translation files to match
     the names of design templates, such name relation is set inside
     the matching list itself.


     trunk/Translations/Identity/Path/To/Dir
     |-- 01-welcome.sed
     |-- 02-donate.sed
     |-- 03-docs.sed
     `-- 04-support.sed

*One entry under `trunk/trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/':*
     In order to produce different translated images using specific
     design templates, we need to specify the relation between
     translation files and design templates in a way that
     `centos-art.sh' could know exactly what translation file to apply
     to what design template. This relation between translation files
     and design templates is set using the matching list MATCHINGLIST
     variable inside the pre-rendition configuration script of the
     component we want to produce images for.


     trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Path/To/Dir
     `-- render.conf.sh

     In this configuration the pre-rendition configuration script
     (`render.conf.sh') would look like the following:


     function render_loadConfig {

         # Define rendition actions.
         ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'

         # Define matching list.
         MATCHINGLIST="\
         paragraph.svg:\
             01-welcome.sed\
             02-donate.sed\
             04-support.sed
         list.svg:\
             03-docs.sed
         "

     }

     As result, `centos-art.sh' will produce `01-welcome.png',
     `02-donate.png' and `04-support.png' using the paragraph-based
     design template, but `03-docs.png' using the list-based design
     template.

2.71.1.4 Design template with translation (optimized+flexibility)
.................................................................

In the production models we've seen so far, there are design templates
to produce untranslated images and translation files which combiend
with design templates produce translated images. That may seems like
all our needs are covered, doesn't it? Well, it _almost_ does.

   Generally, we use design templates to define how final images will
look like. Generally, each renderable directory structure has one
`Tpl/' directory where we organize design templates for that identity
component. So, we can say that there is only one unique design template
definition for each identity component; or what is the same, said
differently, identity components can be produced in one way only, the
way its own design template directory specifies.  This is not enough
for theme production. It is a limitation, indeed.

   Initially, to create one theme, we created one renderable directory
structure for each theme component. When we found ourselves with many
themes, and components inside them, it was obvious that the same design
model was duplicated inside each theme. As design models were
independently one another, if we changed one theme's design model, that
change was useless to other themes. So, in order to reuse design model
changes, we unified design models into one common directory structure.

   With design models unified in a common structure, another problem
rose up. As design models also had the visual style of theme components,
there was no difference between themes, so there was no apparent need
to have an independent theme directory structure for each different
theme.  So, it was also needed to separate visual styles from design
models.

   At this point there are two independent worklines: one directory
structure to store design models (the final image characteristics
[i.e., dimensions, translation markers, etc.]) and one directory
structure to store visual styles (the final image visual style [i.e.,
the image look and feel]).  So, it is possible to handle both different
design models and different visual styles independtly one another and
later create combinations among them using `centos-art.sh'.

   For example, consider the following configuration:

*One entry under `trunk/Identity/Themes/Models/':*
     The design model entry exists to organize design model files
     (similar to design templates). Both design models and design
     templates are very similar; they both should have the
     `CENTOSARTWORK' export id present to identify the exportation
     area, translation marks, etc.  However, design models do use
     dynamic backgrounds inclusion while design templates don't.


                             THEMEMODEL | | The bond component
                                  |<----| |--------------------->|
     trunk/Identity/Themes/Models/Default/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
     |-- paragraph.svg
     `-- list.svg

     Inisde design models, dynamic backgrounds are required in order for
     different artistic motifs to reuse common design models. Firstly,
     in order to create dynamic backgrounds inside design models, we
     import a bitmap to cover design model's background and later,
     update design model's path information to replace fixed values to
     dynamic values.

*One entry under `trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/':*
     The artistic motif entry defines the visual style we want to
     produce images for, only. Final images (i.e., those built from
     combining both design models and artistic motif backrounds) are
     not stored here, but under branches directory structure. In the
     artistic motif entry, we only define those images that cannot be
     produced automatically by `centos-art.sh' (e.g., Backgrounds,
     Color information, Screenshots, etc.).


                       Artistic motif name | | Artistic motif backgrounds

         `-- 510x300.xcf

*One entry under `trunk/Translations/':*
     The translation entry specifies, by means of translation files, the
     language-specific information we want to produce image for. When we
     create the translation entry we don't use the name of neither
     design model nor artistic motif, just the design model component
     we want to produce images for.

*One entry under `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/':*
     There is one pre-rendition configuration script for each theme
     component. So, each time a theme component is rendered, its
     pre-rendition configuration script is evaluated to teach
     `centos-art.sh' how to render the component.


     trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Themes/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
     `-- render.conf.sh

     In this configuration the pre-rendition configuration script
     (`render.conf.sh') would look like the following:


     function render_loadConfig {

         # Define rendition actions.
         ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'

         # Define matching list.

     }

2.71.2 Renderable translation directory structures
--------------------------------------------------

Translation directory structures are auxiliar structures of renderable
identity directory structures. There is one translation directory
structure for each renderable identity directory structure.  Inside
translation directory structures we organize translation files used by
renderable identity directory structures that produce translated
images. Renderable identity directory structures that produce
untranslated images don't use translation files, but they do use a
translation directory structure, an empty translation directory
structure, to be precise.

   In order to aliviate production of translation file, we made
translation directory structures renderable adding a template (`Tpl/')
directory structure to handle common content inside translation files.
This way, we work on translation templates and later use
`centos-art.sh' to produce specific translation files (based on
translation templates) for different information (e.g., languages,
release numbers, architectures, etc.).

   If for some reason, translation files get far from translation
templates and translation templates become incovenient to produce such
translation files then, care should be taken to avoid replacing the
content of translation files with the content of translation templates
when `centos-art.sh' is executed to produce translation files from
translation templates.

   Inside renderable translation directory structures, `centos-art.sh'
can produce text-based files only.

2.71.3 Copying renderable directory structures
----------------------------------------------

A renderable layout is formed by design models, design images,
pre-rendition configuration scripts and translations files. This way,
when we say to duplicate rendition stuff we are saying to duplicate
these four directory structures (i.e., design models, design images,
pre-rendition configuration scripts, and related translations files).

   When we duplicate directories, inside `trunk/Identity' directory
structure, we need to be aware of renderable layout described above and
the source location used to perform the duplication action.  The source
location is relevant to centos-art.sh script in order to determine the
required auxiliar information inside directory structures that need to
be copied too (otherwise we may end up with orphan directory structures
unable to be rendered, due the absence of required information).

   In order for a renderable directory structure to be valid, the new
directory structure copied should match the following conditions:

  1. To have a unique directory structure under `trunk/Identity',
     organized by any one of the above organizational designs above.

  2. To have a unique directory structure under `trunk/Translations' to
     store translation files.

  3. To have a unique directory structure under
     `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config' to set pre-rendition
     configuration script.

   As convenction, the `render_doCopy' function uses `trunk/Identity'
directory structure as source location.  Once the `trunk/Identity'
directory structure has been specified and verified, the related path
information is built from it and copied automatically to the new
location specified by FLAG_TO variable.

   Design templates + No translation:

   Command: - centos-art render -copy=trunk/Identity/Path/To/Dir

   Notice that design models are not included in source or target
locations. This is intentional. In "Renderable layout 2", design models
live by their own, they just exist, they are there, available for any
artistic motif to use. By default `Themes/Models/Default' design model
directory structure is used, but other design models directory
structures (under Themes/Models/) can be created and used changing the
value of THEMEMODEL variable inside the pre-rendition configuration
script of the artistic motif source location you want to produce.

   Notice how translations and pre-rendition configuration scripts may
both be equal in source and target. This is because such structures are
common to all artistic motifs (the default values to use when no
specific values are provided).

   - The common directory structures are not copied or deleted. We
cannot   copy a directory structure to itself.

   - The common directory structures represent the default value to use
 when no specific translations and/or pre-rendition configuration
script are provided inside source location.

   - The specific directory structures, if present, are both copiable
and   removable. This is, when you perform a copy or delete action from
 source, that source specific auxiliar directories are transfered in
the copy action to a new location (that specified by FLAG_TO
variable).

   - When translations and/or pre-rendition configuration scripts are
found inside the source directory structure, the centos-art.sh   script
loads common auxiliar directories first and later specific   auxiliar
directories.  This way, identity rendition of source   locations can be
customized idividually over the base of common   default values.

   - The specific auxiliar directories are optional.

   - The common auxiliar directories should be present always. This is,
 in order to provide the information required by render functionality
(i.e., to make it functional in the more basic level of its
existence).

   Notice how the duplication process is done from `trunk/Identity' on,
not the oposite. If you try to duplicate a translation structure (or
similar auxiliar directory structures like pre-rendition configuration
scripts), the `trunk/Identity' for that translation is not created.
This limitation is impossed by the fact that many `trunk/Identity'
directory structures may reuse/share the same translation directory
structure. We cannot delete one translation (or similar) directory
structures while a related `trunk/Identity/' directory structure is
still in need of it.

   The `render_doCopy' functionality does duplicate directory structures
directly involved in rendition process only. Once such directories have
been duplicated, the functionality stops thereat.

2.72 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/Functions/Render/Config' Directory
===================================================================

2.72.1 Goals
------------

The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Config' directory exists to oraganize
pre-rendering configuration scripts.

2.72.2 Description
------------------

Pre-rendering configuration scripts let you customize the way
`centos-art.sh' script renders identity and translation repository
entries.  Pre-rendering configuration scripts are `render.conf.sh'
files with `render_loadConfig' function definition inside.

   There is one `render.conf.sh' file for each pre-rendering
configuration entry. Pre-rendering configuration entries can be based
both on identity and translation repository entires.  Pre-rendering
configuration entries are required for each identity entry, but not for
translation entries.

2.72.2.1 The `render.conf.sh' identity model
............................................

Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, we consider identity entries to all
directories under `trunk/Identity' directory. Identity entries can be
image-based or text-based. When you render image-based identity entries
you need to use image-based pre-rendering configuration scripts.
Likewise, when you render text-based identity entries you need to use
text-based pre-rendering configuration scripts.

   Inside identity pre-rendering configuration scripts, image-based
pre-rendering configuration scripts look like the following:


#!/bin/bash

function render_loadConfig {

    # Define rendering actions.
    ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'
    ACTIONS[1]='POST:renderFormats: tif xpm pdf ppm'

}

   Inside identity pre-rendering configuration scripts, text-based
pre-rendering configuration scripts look like the following:


#!/bin/bash

function render_loadConfig {

    # Define rendering actions.
    ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderText'
    ACTIONS[1]='POST:formatText: --width=70 --uniform-spacing'

}

   When using identity pre-rendering configuration scripts, you can
extend both image-based and text-based pre-rendering configuration
scripts using image-based and text-based post-rendering actions,
respectively.

2.72.2.2 The `render.conf.sh' translation model
...............................................

Translation pre-rendering configuration scripts take precedence before
default translation rendering action. Translation pre-rendering actions
are useful when default translation rendering action do not fit itself
to translation entry rendering requirements.

2.72.2.3 The `render.conf.sh' rendering actions
...............................................

Inside both image-based and text-based identity pre-rendering
configuration scripts, we use the `ACTIONS' array variable to define
the way `centos-art.sh' script performs identity rendering.  Identity
rendering is organized by one `BASE' action, and optional `POST' and
`LAST' rendering actions.

   The `BASE' action specifies what kind of rendering does the
`centos-art.sh' script will perform with the files related to the
pre-rendering configuration script. The `BASE' action is required.
Possible values to `BASE' action are either `renderImage' or
`renderText' only.

   To specify the `BASE' action you need to set the `BASE:' string
followed by one of the possible values. For example, if you want to
render images, consider the following definition of `BASE' action:


ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'

   Only one `BASE' action must be specified. If more than one `BASE'
action is specified, the last one is used. If no `BASE' action is
specified at all, an error is triggered and the `centos-art.sh' script
ends its execution.

   The `POST' action specifies which action to apply for each file
rendered (at the rendering time). This action is optional.  You can set
many different `POST' actions to apply many different actions over the
same already rendered file. Possible values to `POST' action are
`renderFormats', `renderSyslinux', `renderGrub', etc.

   To specify the `POST' action, you need to use set the `POST:'
followed by the function name of the action you want to perform.  The
exact form depends on your needs. For example, consider the following
example to produce `xpm', `jpg', and `tif' images, based on already
rendered `png' image, and also organize the produced files in
directories named as their own extensions:


ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'
ACTIONS[1]='POST:renderFormats: xpm jpg tif'
ACTIONS[2]='POST:groupByFormat: png xpm jpg tif'

   In the previous example, file organization takes place at the moment
of rendering, just after producing the `png' base file and before going
to the next file in the list of files to render. If you don't want to
organized the produced files in directories named as their own
extensions, just remove the `POST:groupByFormat' action line:


ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'
ACTIONS[1]='POST:renderFormats: xpm jpg tif'

   The `LAST' action specifies which actions to apply once the last
file in the list of files to process has been rendered. The `LAST'
action is optional. Possible values for `LAST' actions may be
`groupByFormat', `renderGdmTgz', etc.

     *Note* -- *Removed*(xref:trunk Scripts Bash Functions Render) --,
     to know more about possible values for `BASE', `POST' and `LAST'
     action definitions.

   To specify the `LAST' action, you need to set the `LAST:' string
followed by the function name of the action you want to perform.  For
example, consider the following example if you want to render all files
first and organize them later:


ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'
ACTIONS[1]='POST:renderFormats: xpm jpg tif'
ACTIONS[2]='LAST:groupByformat: png xpm jpg tif'

2.72.3 Usage
------------

Use the following commands to administer both identity and translation
pre-rendering configuration scripts:

`centos-art config --create='path/to/dir/''
     Use this command to create `path/to/dir' related pre-rendering
     configuration script.

`centos-art config --edit='path/to/dir/''
     Use this command to edit `path/to/dir' related pre-rendering
     configuration script.

`centos-art config --read='path/to/dir/''
     Use this command to read `path/to/dir' related pre-rendering
     configuration script.

`centos-art config --remove='path/to/dir/''
     Use this command to remove `path/to/dir' related pre-rendering
     configuration script.


   In the commands above, `path/to/dir' refers to one renderable
directory path under `trunk/Identity' or `trunk/Translations'
structures only.

2.73 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/Functions/Shell' Directory
===========================================================

2.73.1 Goals
------------

This section exists to organize files related to `shell' functionality
of `centos-art.sh' script.

2.73.2 Description
------------------

The `shell' functionality of `centos-art.sh' script helps you to
maintain bash scripts inside repository. For example, suppose you've
created many functionalities for `centos-art.sh' script, and you want
to use a common copyright and license note for consistency in all your
script files. If you have a bunch of files, doing this one by one
wouldn't be a big deal. In contrast, if the amount of files grows,
updating the copyright and license note for all of them would be a task
rather tedious. The `shell' functionality exists to solve maintainance
tasks just as the one previously mentioned.

   When you use `shell' functionality to update copyright inside script
files, it is required that your script files contain (at least) the
following top commentary structure:


 1| #!/bin/bash
 2| #
 3| # doSomething.sh -- The function description goes here.
 4| #
 5| # Copyright
 6| #
 7| # ...
 8| #
 9| # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
10| # $Id$
11| # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
12|
13| function doSomething {
14|
15| }

Figure 2.4: The functions script base comment structure

   Relevant lines in the above structure are lines from 5 to 9.
Everything else in the file is left immutable.

   When you are updating copyright through `shell' functionality,  the
`centos-art.sh' script replaces everything in-between line 5 --the
first one matching `^# Copyright .+$' string-- and line 9--the first
long dash separator matching `^# -+$'-- with the content of copyright
template instance.

     *Caution* Be sure to add the long dash separator that matches `^#
     -+$' regular expression _before_ the function definition.
     Otherwise, if the `Copyright' line is present but no long dash
     separator exists, `centos-art.sh' will remove anything in-between
     the `Copyright' line and the end of file. This way you may lost
     your function definitions entirely.

   The copyright template instance is created from one copyright
template stored in the `Config/tpl_forCopyright.sed' file.  The template
instance is created once, and later removed when no longer needed. At
this moment, when template instance is created, the `centos-art.sh'
script takes advantage of automation in order to set copyright full
name and date dynamically.

   When you use `shell' functionality to update copyright, the first
thing `shell' functionality does is requesting copyright information to
user, and later, if values were left empty (i.e., no value was typed
before pressing <RET> key), the `shell' functionality uses its own
default values.

   When `shell' functionality uses its own default values, the final
copyright note looks like the following:


 1| #!/bin/bash
 2| #
 3| # doSomthing.sh -- The function description goes here.
 4| #

26| function doSomething {
27|
28| }

Figure 2.5: The function script comment example

   Relevant lines in the above structure are lines from 5 to 22.  Pay
attention how the copyright line was built, and how the license was
added into the top comment where previously was just three dots.
Everything else in the file was left immutable.

   To change copyright information (i.e., full name or year
information), run the `shell' functionality over the root directory
containing the script files you want to update copyright in and enter
the appropriate information when it be requested. You can run the
`shell' functionality as many times as you need to.

   To change copyright license (i.e., the text in-between lines 7 and
20), you need to edit the `Config/tpl_forCopyright.sed' file, set the
appropriate information, and run the `shell' functionality once again
for changes to take effect over the files you specify.

     *Important* The `centos-art.sh' script is released as:


     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

     Do not change the license information under which `centos-art.sh'
     script is released. Instead, if you think a different license must
     be used, please share your reasons at CentOS Developers mailing
     list <centos-devel@centos-art.sh>.

2.73.3 Usage
------------

`centos-art sh --update-copyright='path/to/dir''
`centos-art sh --update-copyright='path/to/dir' --filter='regex''
     Use these commands to update copyright information in `.sh' files
     under `path/to/dir' directory.

   When you provide `--filter='regex'' argument, the list of files to
process is reduced as specified in `regex' regular expression.  Inside
`centos-art.sh' script, the `regex' regular expression is used in
combination with `find' command to look for files matching the regular
expression path pattern.

     *Warning* In order for `regex' regular expression to match a file,
     the `regex' regular expresion must match the whole file path not
     just the file name.

   For example, if you want to match all `render.conf.sh' files inside
`path/to/dir', use the `.+/render.conf' regular expression.  Later,
`centos-art.sh' script uses this value inside `^$REGEX\.sh$' expression
in order to build the final regular expression (i.e.,
`^.+/render.conf\.sh$') that is evaluated against available file paths
inside the list of files to process.

   Exceptionally, when you provide `--filter='regex'' in the way that
`regex', appended to `path/to/dir/' (i.e.  `path/to/dir/regex'),
matches a regular file; the `centos-art.sh' script uses the file
matching as only file in the list of files to process.

2.74 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/Functions/Svg' Directory
=========================================================

2.74.1 Goals
------------

This section exists to organize files related to `svg' functionality of
`centos-art.sh' script.

2.74.2 Description
------------------

The `svg' functionality of `centos-art.sh' script helps you to maintain
scalable vector graphics (SVG) inside repository. For example, suppose
you've been working in CentOS default design models under
`trunk/Identity/Themes/Models/', and you want to set common metadata to
all of them, and later remove all unused SVG defintions from `*.svg'
files. Doing so file by file may be a tedious task, so the
`centos-art.sh' script provides the `svg' functionality to aid you
maintain such actions.

2.74.2.1 Metadata maintainance
..............................

The metadata used is defined by Inkscape 0.46 using the SVG standard
markup. The `centos-art.sh' script replaces everything in-between
`<metadata' and `</metadata>' tags with a predefined metadata template
we've set for this purpose.

   The metadata template was created using the metadata information of a
file which, using Inkscape 0.46, all metadata fields were set. This
created a complete markup representation of how SVG metadata would look
like. Later, we replaced every single static value with a translation
marker in the form `=SOMETEXT=', where `SOMETEXT' is the name of its
main opening tag. Later, we transform the metadata template into a sed
replacement set of commads escaping new lines at the end of each line.

   With metadata template in place, the `centos-art.sh' script uses it
to create a metadata template instance for the file being processed
currently.  The metadata template instance contains the metadata
portion of sed replacement commands with translation markers already
traduced.  In this action, instance creation, is where we take
advantage of automation and generate metadata values like title, date,
keywords, source, identifier, and relation dynamically, based on the
file path `centos-art.sh' script is currently creating metadata
information for.

   With metadata template instance in place, the `centos-art.sh' script
uses it to replace real values inside all `.svg' files under the
current location you're running the `centos-art.sh' script on.  Default
behaviour is to ask user to enter each metadatum required, one by one.
If user leaves metadatum empty, by pressing <RET> key, `centos-art.sh'
uses its default value.

   The `centos-art.sh' script modifies the following metadata:

`Title'
     Name by which this document is formally known. If no value is set
     here, `centos-art.sh' script uses the file name as title.

`Date'
     Date associated with the creation of this document (YYYY-MM-DD).
     If no value is set here, `centos-art.sh' script uses the current
     date information as in `date +%Y-%m-%d'.

`Creator'
     Name of entity primarily responsible for making the content of this
     document. If no value is set here, `centos-art.sh' script uses the
     string `The CentOS Project'.

`Rights'
     Name of entity with rights to the intellectual Property of this
     document. If no value is set here, `centos-art.sh' script uses the
     string `The CentOS Project'.

`Publisher'
     Name of entity responsible for making this document available. If
     no value is set here, `centos-art.sh' script uses the string `The
     CentOS Project'.

`Identifier'
     Unique URI to reference this document. If no value is set here,
     `centos-art.sh' script uses the current file path to build the
     related url that points to current file location inside repository
     central server.

`Source'
     Unique URI to reference the source of this document. If no value is
     set here, `centos-art.sh' script uses current file path to build
     the related url that points to current file location inside
     repository central server.

`Relation'
     Unique URI to a related document. If no value is set here,
     `centos-art.sh' script uses current file path to build the related
     url that points to current file location inside repository central
     server.

`Language'
     Two-letter language tag with optional subtags for the language of
     this document. (e.g. `en-GB'). If no value is set here,
     `centos-art.sh' script uses the current locale information as in
     `cli_getCurrentLocale' function.

`Keywords'
     The topic of this document as comma-separated key words, prhases,
     or classifications. If no value is set here, `centos-art.sh' script
     uses file path to build

`Coverage'
     Extent or scope of this document. If no value is set here,
     `centos-art.sh' script uses the string `The CentOS Project'.

`Description'
     Description about the document. If no value is set here,
     `centos-art.sh' script uses uses empty value as default.

`Contributors'
     People that contributes in the creation/maintainance of the
     document.  If no value is set here, `centos-art.sh' script uses
     uses empty value as default.

   The `License' metadatum is not set as a choise, by now. It is fixed
Creative Common Attribution Share-Alike 3.0 License
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). This is done in order
to grant license consistency among all SVG files we manage inside CentOS
Artwork Repository.

2.74.2.2 Unused definitions
...........................

Many of the no-longer-used gradients, patterns, and markers (more
precisely, those which you edited manually) remain in the corresponding
palettes and can be reused for new objects. However if you want to
optimize your document, use the `Vacuum Defs' command in `File' menu.
It will remove any gradients, patterns, or markers which are not used
by anything in the document, making the file smaller.

   If you have one or two couple of files, removing unused definitions
using the graphical interface may be enough to you.  In contrast, if
you have dozens or even houndreds of scalable vector graphics files to
maintain it is not a fun task to use the graphical interface to remove
unused definitions editing those files one by one.

   To remove unused definitions from several scalable vector graphics
files, the `centos-art.sh' script uses Inkscape command-line interface,
specifically with the `--vaccum-defs' option.

2.74.3 Usage
------------

`centos-art svg --update-metadata='path/to/dir''

`centos-art svg --update-metadata='path/to/dir' --filter='regex''
     Use these commands to update metadata information to `.svg' files
     under `path/to/dir' directory.

`centos-art svg --vacuum-defs='path/to/dir''

`centos-art svg --vacuum-defs='path/to/dir' --filter='regex''
     Use these commands to remove unused definitions inside `.svg'
     files under `path/to/dir' directory.

   When you provide `--filter='regex'' argument, the list of files to
process is reduced as specified in `regex' regular expression.  Inside
`centos-art.sh' script, the `regex' regular expression is used in
combination with `find' command to look for files matching the regular
expression path pattern.

     *Warning* In order for `regex' regular expression to match a file,
     the `regex' regular expresion must match the whole file path not
     just the file name.

   For example, if you want to match all `summary.svg' files inside
`path/to/dir', use the `.+/summary' regular expression.  Later,
`centos-art.sh' script uses this value inside `^$REGEX\.svg$'
expression in order to build the final regular expression (i.e.,
`^.+/summary\.svg$') that is evaluated against available file paths
inside the list of files to process.

   Exceptionally, when you provide `--filter='regex'' in the way that
`regex', appended to `path/to/dir/' (i.e.  `path/to/dir/regex'),
matches a regular file; the `centos-art.sh' script uses the file
matching as only file in the list of files to process.

2.75 The `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Cli/Functions/Verify' Directory
============================================================

2.75.1 Goals
------------

This section exists to organize files related to `centos-art.sh' script
`verify' functionality.  The `verify' functionality of `centos-art.sh'
script helps you to verify the workstation configuration you are
planning to use as host for your working copy of CentOS Artwork
Repository.

2.75.2 Description
------------------

The first time you download CentOS Artwork Repository you need to
configure your workstation in order to use `centos-art.sh' script.
These preliminar configurations are based mainly on auxiliar RPM
packages installation, symbolic links creations, and environment
variables definitions.  The `verify' functionality of `centos-art.sh'
script guides you through this preliminar configuration process.

   If this is the first time you run `centos-art.sh' script, the
appropriate way to use its `verify' functionality is not using the
`centos-art.sh' script directly, but the absolute path to
`centos-art.sh' script instead (i.e.,
`~/artwork/trunk/Scripts/Bash/centos-art.sh').  This is necessary
because `centos-art' symbolic link, under `~/bin/' directory, has not
been created yet.

2.75.2.1 Packages
.................

Installation of auxiliar RPM packages provides the software required to
manipulate files inside the repository (e.g., image files,
documentation files, translation files, script files, etc.). Most of
RPM packages `centos-art.sh' script uses are shipped with CentOS
distribution, and can be installed from CentOS base repository.  The
only exception is `inkscape', the package we use to manipulate SVG
files.  The `inkscape' package is not inside CentOS distribution so it
needs to be installed from third party repositories.

     *Note* Configuration of third party repositories inside CentOS
     distribution is described in CentOS wiki, specifically in the
     following URL:
     `http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories'

   Before installing packages, the `centos-art.sh' script uses `sudo'
to request root privileges to execute `yum' installation functionality.
If your user isn't defined as a privileged user--at least to run `yum'
commands-- inside `/etc/sudoers' configuration file, you will not be
able to perform package installation tasks as set in `centos-art.sh'
script `verify' functionality.

   Setting sudo privileges to users is an administrative task you have
to do by yourself. If you don't have experience with `sudo' command,
please read its man page running the command: `man sudo'. This reading
will be very useful, and with some practice, you will be able to
configure your users to have `sudo' privileges.

2.75.2.2 Links
..............

Creation of symbolic links helps us to alternate between different
implementations of `centos-art.sh' script-line (e.g., `centos-art.sh',
for Bash implementation; `centos-art.py', for Python implementation;
`centos-art.pl', for Perl implementation; and so on for other
implementations). The `centos-art.sh' script-line definition takes
place inside your personal binary (`~/bin/') directory in order to make
the script implementation --the one that `centos-art' links to--
available to PATH environment variable.

   Creation of symbolic links helps us to reuse components from
repository working copy. For example, color information files
maintained inside your working copy must never be duplicated inside
program-specific configuration directories that uses them in your
workstation (e.g., Gimp, Inkscape, etc.).  Instead, a symbolic link
must be created for each one of them, from program-specific
configuration directories to files in the working copy.  In this
configuration, when someone commits changes to color information files
up to central repository, they--the changes committed-- will be
immediatly available to your programs the next time you update your
working copy --the place inside your workstation those color
information files are stored--.

   Creation of symbolic links helps us to make `centos-art.sh' script
functionalities available outside `trunk/' repository directory
structure, but at its same level in repository tree. This is useful if
you need to use the "render" functionality of `centos-art.sh' under
`branches/' repository directory structure as you usually do inside
`trunk/' repository directory structure. As consequence of this
configuration, automation scripts cannot be branched under
`branches/Scripts' directory structure.

2.75.2.3 Environment variables
..............................

Definition of environemnt variables helps us to set default values to
our user session life. The user session environment variable defintion
takes place in the user's `~/.bash_profile' file.  The `verify'
functionality of `centos-art.sh' script doesn't modify your
`~/.bash_profile' file.

   The `verify' functionality of `centos-art.sh' script evaluates the
following environment variables:

`EDITOR'
     Default text editor.

     The `centos-art.sh' script uses default text `EDITOR' to edit
     pre-commit subversion messages, translation files, configuration
     files, script files, and similar text-based files.

     If `EDITOR' environment variable is not set, `centos-art.sh'
     script uses `/usr/bin/vim' as default text editor. Otherwise, the
     following values are recognized by `centos-art.sh' script:

        * `/usr/bin/vim'

        * `/usr/bin/emacs'

        * `/usr/bin/nano'

     If no one of these values is set in `EDITOR' environment variable,
     `centos-art.sh' uses `/usr/bin/vim' text editor by default.

`TEXTDOMAIN'
     Default domain used to retrieve translated messages.  This
     variable is set in `initFunctions.sh' and shouldn't be changed.

`TEXTDOMAINDIR'
     Default directory used to retrieve translated messages.  This
     variable is set in `initFunctions.sh' and shouldn't be changed.

`LANG'
     Default locale information.

     This variable is initially set in the configuration process of
     CentOS distribution installer (i.e., Anaconda), specifically in the
     `Language' step; or once installed using the
     `system-config-language' tool.

     The `centos-art.sh' script uses the LANG environment variable to
     know in which language the script messages are printed out.

`TZ'
     Default time zone representation.

     This variable is initially set in the configuration process of
     CentOS distribution installer (i.e., Anaconda), specifically in the
     `Date and time' step; or once installed using the
     `system-config-date' tool.

     The `centos-art.sh' script doesn't use the TZ environment variable
     information at all. Instead, this variable is used by the system
     shell to show the time information according to your phisical
     location on planet Earth.

     Inside your computer, the time information is firstly set in the
     BIOS clock (which may need correction), and later in the
     configuration process of CentOS distribution installer (or later,
     by any of the related configuration tools inside CentOS
     distribution).  Generally, setting time information is a
     straight-forward task and configuration tools available do cover
     most relevant location. However, if you need a time precision not
     provided by the configuration tools available inside CentOS
     distribution then, using TZ variable may be necessary.

          *Convenction* In order to keep changes syncronized between
          central repository and its working copies: configure both
          repository server and workstations (i.e., the place where
          each working copy is set on) to use Coordinated Universal
          Time (UTC) as base time representation.  Later, correct the
          time information for your specific location using time zone
          correction.

     The format of TZ environment variable is described in `tzset(3)'
     manual page.


2.75.3 Usage
------------

`centos-art verify --packages'
     Verify required packages your workstation needs in order to run the
     `centos-art.sh' script correctly.  If there are missing packages,
     the `centos-art.sh' script asks you to confirm their installation.
     When installing packages, the `centos-art.sh' script uses the
     `yum' application in order to achieve the task.

     In case all packages required by `centos-art.sh' script are
     already installed in your workstation, the message `The required
     packages are already installed.' is output for you to know.

`centos-art verify --links'
     Verify required links your workstation needs in order to run the
     centos-art command correctly.  If any required link is missing, the
     `centos-art.sh' script asks you to confirm their installation.  To
     install required links, the `centos-art.sh' script uses the `ln'
     command.

     In case all links required by `centos-art.sh' script are already
     created in your workstation, the message `The required links are
     already installed.' is output for you to know.

     In case a regular file exists with the same name of a required
     link, the `centos-art.sh' script outputs the `Already exists as
     regular file.' message when listing required links that will be
     installed. Of course, as there is already a regular file where
     must be a link, no link is created. In such cases the
     `centos-art.sh' script will fall into a continue installation
     request for that missing link.  To end this continue request you
     can answer `No', or remove the existent regular file to let
     `centos-art.sh' script install the link on its place.

`centos-art verify --environment'
`centos-art verify --environment --filter='regex''
     Output a brief description of environment variables used by
     `centos-art.sh' script.

     If `--filter' option is provided, output is reduced as defined in
     the `regex' regular expression value. If `--filter' option is
     specified but `regex' value is not, the `centos-art.sh' script
     outputs information as if `--filter' option had not been provided
     at all.
