\chapter{CentOS Redistribution License}
\noindent Revision 1.0, March 2010\\
\noindent Copyright \copyright\ 2010 The CentOS Project.\\
\\
\noindent The \texttt{redhat-logos} and \texttt{redhat-artwork}
packages (the ``Packages'') contain image files which incorporate the
CentOS trademark, and CentOS logo (the ``Marks'').

The CentOS Project grants you the right to use the Packages during the
normal operation of other software programs that call upon the
Packages.  The CentOS Project grants to you the right and license to
copy and redistribute the unaltered Packages for both commerical and
non-commercial purposes.

If you are rebranding or modifying the underlying distribution, or the
Packages, you must remove ``the Marks'' and rename the distribution
something other than CentOS.

When redistributing using this license, the following applies:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The above copyright notice and this license are included with
each copy you make, and they remain intact and are not altered,
deleted, or modified in any way;

\item You do not modify the appearance of any or all of the Logos in
any manner; and

\item You do not use any or all of the Logos as, or as part of, a
trademark, trade name, or trade identifier; or in any other fashion
except as set forth in this license.

\item No Warranty. The Packages are provided ``as are'' and any
express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall the CentOS Project be liable
for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or
consequential damages ---including, but not limited to, procurement of
substitute goods or services; loss of use, data or profits; or
business interruption--- however caused and on any theory of
liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort ---including
negligence or otherwise--- arising in any way out of the use of this
package, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

\end{enumerate}
