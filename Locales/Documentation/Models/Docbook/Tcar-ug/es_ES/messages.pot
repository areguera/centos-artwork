"Texinfo documentation format is very good producing online "

"Intermediate formats like XML and Docbook provide an alternative to "

"is no supported way inside The CentOS Distribution to transformed a "
"localized XML file back into texinfo format, nor a way of producing "
"well formed Docbook documents from Texinfo source files. Thus, one "

"The licenses for most software are designed to take away your "

"This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software "
"Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit "

"covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can "
"apply it to your programs, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not "
"price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that "
"you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and "
"charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code "
"or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or "
"use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do "
"these things."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid "
"anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the "
"rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities "
"for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify "
"it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether "
"gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights "
"that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can "
"get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they "
"know their rights."
msgstr ""

msgid "We protect your rights with two steps:"

"offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make "

"this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and "
"passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is "
"not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will "
"not reflect on the original authors' reputations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software "
"patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free "
"program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making "
"the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear "
"that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not "

"Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification"
msgstr ""

msgid "Section 1"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source "
"code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you "
"conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate "
"copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the "
"notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any "
"warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of "
"this License along with the Program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, "
"and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange "
"for a fee."
msgstr ""

msgid "Section 2"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of "
"it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and "
"distribute such modifications or work under the terms of <xref "
"linkend=\"licenses-gpl-1-1\"/> above, provided that you also meet "
"all of these conditions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices "
"stating that you changed the files and the date of any change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in "
"whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any "
"part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third "
"parties under the terms of this License."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when "
"run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive "
"use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement "
"including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there "
"is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and "
"that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and "
"telling the user how to view a copy of this License."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exception"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print "
"such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not "
"required to print an announcement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If "
"identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the "
"Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate "
"works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply "
"to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But "
"when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a "
"work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on "
"the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees "
"extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part "
"regardless of who wrote it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or "
"contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the "
"intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of "
"derivative or collective works based on the Program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the "
"Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a "

"accord with Subsection b above.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for "
"making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source "
"code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus "
"any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to "
"control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as "
"a special exception, the source code distributed need not include "
"anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary "
"form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of "
"the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that "
"component itself accompanies the executable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering "
"access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent "
"access to copy the source code from the same place counts as "
"distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not "
"compelled to copy the source along with the object code."

msgid "Section 4"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program "

"License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from "
"you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so "
"long as such parties remain in full compliance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Section 5"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You are not required to accept this License, since you have not "
"signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or "
"distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are "
"prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by "
"modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the "
"Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, "
"and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or "
"modifying the Program or works based on it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Section 6"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the "
"Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the "
"original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject "
"to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further "
"restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted "
"herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third "

msgid "Section 7"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent "
"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent "
"issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, "
"agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this "
"License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this "
"License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously "
"your obligations under this License and any other pertinent "
"obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the "
"Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit "
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive "
"copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you "
"could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely "
"from distribution of the Program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any "
"patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of "
"any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting "
"the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is "

"If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in "
