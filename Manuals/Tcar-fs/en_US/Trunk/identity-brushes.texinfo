@cindex Trunk identity brushes

The @file{trunk/Identity/Brushes} directory exists to organize GIMP
brushes used inside @value{TCPCVI}. 

A brush is a pixmap or set of pixmaps used for painting through an
image manipulation program like GIMP.  Inside the repository, we've
organized brushes in @emph{common brushes} and @emph{theme-specific
brushes}.  In both cases, brushes are initially created in @file{.xcf}
format and later exported to any of the brush formats recognized by
GIMP (e.g., @file{.gbr} or @file{.gih}) using the same name of its
source file.

In order for brushes to be loaded by GIMP, they must be store
@file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} directory. This location is out of
@value{TCAR} and doesn't provide version control by itself. To be able
of using version controlled brushes inside GIMP, we store brush
related files inside @file{trunk/Identity/Brushes} directory and
create links to them from @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes} directory.

@verbatim
trunk/Identity/Brushes
|-- Corporate
|   `-- symbol.gbr   (file) <-- ~/.gimp-2.2/brushes/corporate-symbol.gbr (link)
|-- TreeFlower
|   |-- flower-1.gbr (file) <-- ~/.gimp-2.2/brushes/treeflower-flower-1.gbr (link)
|   |-- branch-1.gbr (file) <-- ~/.gimp-2.2/brushes/treeflower-branch-1.gbr (link)
|   |-- branch-2.gbr (file) <-- ~/.gimp-2.2/brushes/treeflower-branch-2.gbr (link)
|   `-- trunk-1.gbr  (file) <-- ~/.gimp-2.2/brushes/treeflower-trunk-1.gbr  (link)
`-- Others
    `-- ...
@end verbatim

The entire link preparation and maintainance of brushes inside the
working copy is automated by @code{prepare} functionality of
@command{centos-art.sh} script.

Inside the working copy, brushes might be created individually in
different locations, but they all need to be linked from one unique
location (i.e., @file{~/.gimp-2.2/brushes}).  This configuration may
provoke brush overlapping if a consistent name convenction is not
implemented correctly.  In that sake, file names used for brushes
are combined with the directories they are stored in order to build
unique identifiers.

Brushes produced with GIMP has a description field associated that is
shown in the Brushes panel of GIMP.  This description is set when the
brush is created as @file{.xcf} file and can be updated when it is
exported either to @file{.gbr} or @file{.gih} format. It wouldn't be
too useful to have two or more brushes using the same description so,
we also make description of brush files unique, too. In that sake, use
the file name as description but without including the file extension
(e.g., if we have the @file{centos-flame-3.gbr} brush, its description
would be @code{centos-flame-3}).
