* Add breadcrumbs navigation using header path. Here we need to find a
  way to de-compose h2 headers and create links, to the correct
  documentation section, for each component inside the string (using /
  as separator). Tip: look for customization inside texi2html source
  code.

* Fix default navigation menu. Make browsing section aware only, not
  subsection, nor subsubsection. 

* Add the 'move' action to centos-art.sh script. This action should be
  able to move one directory or file from one location to another
  inside the repository in a way that all path related information to
  the source location being moved to the target location be also
  updated. For example, if you move trunk/Identity/DirSource to
  trunk/Identity/DirTarget these paths need to be updated inside
  documentation files. And not also inside, but outside too. So

    trunk/Manuals/en/Texinfo/Repository/trunk/Identity/DirSource
    trunk/Manuals/es/Texinfo/Repository/trunk/Identity/DirSource

    whould change, automatically, to

    trunk/Manuals/en/Texinfo/Repository/trunk/Identity/DirTarget
    trunk/Manuals/es/Texinfo/Repository/trunk/Identity/DirTarget

    and all references (e.g., @xref, @ref, @pxref, etc.) commands
    inside the whole documentation should reflect the change too. 
    
* Add the 'remove' action to centos-art.sh script. This action should
  be able to remove repository entries and their related information.
  For example, if you remove the path:

    trunk/Identity/DirSource

    the following directories will be removed too:

    trunk/Manuals/$LANG/Texinfo/Repository/trunk/Identity/DirSource
    trunk/Manuals/$LANG/Html/Repository/trunk-Identity-DirSource.html
