    <title>Texinfo Document Localization</title>

    <para>
        The localization of documentation manuals produced through
        texinfo documentation backend takes place by creating one
        documentation manual for each language individually.  These
        manuals don't have a direct relation among themselves except
        that one adopted by people writting them in order to keep
        their content syncronized.  In this configuration translators
        take one documentation manual as reference and produce
        translated versions of it. To keep track of changes, the
        underlaying version control system must be used.

        Notice that <application>gettext</application><footnote>
        <para>
            The <application>gettext</application> program  translates
            a  natural language message into the user's language, by
            looking up the translation in a message catalog. For more

        </footnote> procedures cannot be applied to texinfo source
        files. A possible work around would be to convert each
        documentation manual from texinfo format to XML format and
        then apply <application>gettext</application> procedures on it
        through <command>xml2po</command> command. This would produce
        a translated XML file which can be used to convert back the
        documentation manual to texinfo format so it can be exported
        to convenctional output formats. Even though it is possible to
        convert texinfo source files into XML, the DTD and XSLT files
        required to realize both markup validation and transnformation
        back into texinfo format (or possibly other formats) are not
        available inside &TCD; release 5.5.

    <title>Texinfo Document Language</title>
    <para>
        The language information of documentation manuals produced
        through texinfo documentation backend is declared by texinfo's
        <code>@documentlanguage</code> command and can take any
        language code from ISO-639 as argument. This command is set in
        the manual's main definition file and, generally, there is no
        need to change it unless you mistakently create the manual for
        a locale code different to that one you previously pretended
        to do in first place.
    </para>

    <para>
        The user's session locale information, as set in
        <envar>LANG</envar> environment variable, determines the
        language information used by new documentation manuals created
        through the <function>help</function> functionality of
        <command>centos-art.sh</command> script and its XHTML output
        produced from <command>texi2html</command> command.  The
        user's session locale information can be customized in the
        graphical login screen before login, or once you've login by
        explicitly setting the value of <envar>LANG</envar>
        environment variable inside the
        <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename> file. 
    </para>

    <tip>
    <para>
        To create documentation manuals in English language the
        <envar>LANG</envar> environment variable must be set to
        <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> or something similar.  Likewise, if
        you want to create documentation manuals in a language other
        than English, be sure the <envar>LANG</envar> environment
        variable is set to the appropriate locale code, based on the
        output of <command>locale -a | less</command> command.

    <para>
        When producing output from texinfo source files, the language
        information set by <code>@documentlanguage</code> texinfo
        command is ignored in Info and HTML output produced by
        <command>makeinfo</command> command in the
        <package>texinfo-4.8-14.el5</package> package, but cosidered
        by Tex program to redefine various English words used in the
        output (e.g., <quote>Chapter</quote>, <quote>Index</quote>,
        <quote>See</quote>, and so on) based on the current language
        set in.

    <title>Texinfo Document Encoding</title>
    <para>
        The encoding information of documentation manuals produced
        trhough texinfo documentation backend is declared by texinfo's
        <code>documentlanguage</code> command and can take
        <code>US-ASCII</code>, <code>ISO-8859-1</code>,
        <code>ISO-8859-15</code> or <code>ISO-8859-2</code> as
        argument.  Nevertheless, the encoding information inside
        documentation manuals produced through texinfo documentation
        backend is not declared at all when documentation manuals are
        created for first time in order for documents to be written
        and read in terminals with an UTF-8 encoding set in (as it is
        in &TCD;).
    </para>

    <para>
        When the <code>@documentencoding</code> command is set in
        texinfo source files, the terminal encoding you use to read
        the Info output must be set to that encoding you provided as
        argument for <code>@documentencoding</code> before using an
        Info reader to open the Info output file. Otherwise, when
        terminal and texinfo source files encoding definition differs
        one another, characters defined through texinfo's special way
        of producing floating accents won't be displayed as expected
        (even when the <option>--enable-encoding</option> is
        provided to <command>makeinfo</command> command). On the
        other hand, when the <code>@documentencoding</code> command is
        not set in texinfo source files, it is possible to write
        documentation manuals in a UTF-8 encoding terminal and also
        reading localized Info output, as well.  There is no need to
        use texinfo's special way of producing floating accents since
        the terminal encoding is able to interpret the characters
        initially entered when the texinfo source files were written
        in first place. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
        When texinfo's special way of producing floating accents isn't
        used, HTML entities are not produced in XHTML output produced
        by <command>texi2html</command> command and some accents
        aren't well produced by <command>makeinfo</command> when PDF
        output is produced, either.  In this last case, when producing
        PDF output, you can realize what the floating accents are by
        trying to produce an accentuated Spanish <code>i</code> letter
        (e.g., <code>Ã­</code>). When you do so, you'll note that that
        construction puts the accentuation <emphasis>over</emphasis>
        the <code>i</code> letter's dot, instead of removing the
        <code>i</code> letter's dot and placing the accent in its
        place. In the case of XHTML output, however, it possible to
        produce well localized XHTML output by setting

        on the head section of each XHTML output permits to all web
        browsers supporting UTF-8 encoding to display the character
        information correctly when reading it.
    </para>

    <para>
        Based on these contradictions it was decided not to set the
        @documentencoding command to texinfo source files produced by
        the help functionality of centos-art.sh script. This desition
        restricts texinfo documentation backend from producing well
        localized PDF outputs from texinfo source files but permits it
        to produce well localized Info, Text, and XHTML output that
        can be read on UTF-8 ecoding terminals
