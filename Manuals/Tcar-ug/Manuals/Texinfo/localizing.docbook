    <title>Texinfo Document Localization</title>

    <para>
        Texinfo document localization is based on <envar>LANG</envar>
        environment variable. When you do login to open your user's
        session, the <envar>LANG</envar> environment variable holds
        the locale information of your user's session in the form
        ll_CC.encoding. This information is used by the
        <code>help</code> functionality of
        <command>centos-art.sh</command> script to determine the
        the manual's main language definition and the texinfo document
        template that should be used when documentation manuals
        written in texinfo format are created and maintained,
        respectively.
