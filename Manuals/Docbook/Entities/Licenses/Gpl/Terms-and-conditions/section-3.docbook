    <para>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
    it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
    the following:

    <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>

            <para> Accompany it with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
            under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
            customarily used for software interchange; or,</para>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>

            <para>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
            least three years, to give any third party, for a charge
            no more than your cost of physically performing source
            distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
            corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
            terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
            used for software interchange; or,</para>

            <para>Accompany it with the information you received as
            to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
            (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
            distribution and only if you received the program in
            object code or executable form with such an offer, in
            accord with Subsection b above.)</para>

    </para>
    
    <para>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
    work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
    complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
    contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
    scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
    distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
    executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.</para>
    
    <para>If distribution of executable or object code is made by
    offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
    equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
    counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
    parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
    code.</para>
