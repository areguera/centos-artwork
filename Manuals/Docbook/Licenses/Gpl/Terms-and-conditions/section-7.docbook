    <title>Section 7</title>

    <para>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
    patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
    License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
    your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
    way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
    entirely from distribution of the Program.</para>

    <para>If any portion of this section is held invalid or
    unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
    the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
    intended to apply in other circumstances.</para>

    <para>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
    infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
    validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
    protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
    which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people
    have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
    distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
    if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</para>

    <para>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
    believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</para>
