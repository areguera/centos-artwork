The CentOS Project is organized and managed on Internet by a group of
Administrators which provide their knowledge and personal resources to
build the different major releases of CentOS Distribution and maintain
the required infrastructure. 

The CentOS Project exists by its own, it is not affilieted with any
other organization. The only source of hardware or funding to
distribute the CentOS Distribution is by donations.
