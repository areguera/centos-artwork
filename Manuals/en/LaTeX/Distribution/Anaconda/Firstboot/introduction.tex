This chapter describes the visual style of CentOS firstboot
(1.4.27.3-1.el5.centos). Firstboot is the initial system configuration
utility that guides you through a series of steps for easier
configuration of the machine (keyboard layout, language, time zone,
etc.). Firstboot takes place the first time you boot up your installed
system. Firstboot visual style is controlled by a left banner, always
visible, and a splash image, shown on the welcome screen only.
