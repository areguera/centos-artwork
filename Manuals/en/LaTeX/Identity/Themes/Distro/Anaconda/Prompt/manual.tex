\begin{abstract} 

This article describes Anaconda Prompt. Anaconda Prompt is the first
screen shown after booting up with the install CD/DVD medium. Anaconda
Prompt is based on H. Peter Anvin's syslinux suite of bootloaders,
specifically on the \texttt{isolinux} bootloader. The
\texttt{syslinux} suite and its documentation come inside the
\texttt{syslinux} package, available through \texttt{yum} in the
\texttt{[base]} repository of CentOS Distribution.

Anaconda is the name of the install program used by CentOS.  It is
python-based with some custom modules written in C. The anaconda
installer works on a wide variety of Linux-based computing
architectures (ia32, Itanium, Alpha, S/390, PowerPC), and is designed
to make it easy to add platforms.
