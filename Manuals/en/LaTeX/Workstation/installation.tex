This chapter describes tools you need to have installed in your CentOS
workstation before using CentOS Artwork Repository.

\section{Subversion}

Subversion is a version control system, which allows you to keep old
versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log of
who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or
SCCS.\footnote{More documentation about Subversion and its tools,
including detailed usage explanations of the svn, svnadmin, svnserve
and svnlook programs, historical background, philosophical approaches
and reasonings, etc., can be found at
\url{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.}} 

To install Subversion client tools in your workstation you can use the
following command:

\section{Inkscape}

Inkscape is a GUI editor for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format
drawing files, with capabilities similar to Adobe Illustrator,

bezier paths, freehand drawing, multiline text, text on path, alpha
blending, arbitrary affine transforms, gradient and pattern fills,
node editing, SVG-to-PNG export, grouping, layers, live clones, and
more.

Note that Inkscape is not inside CentOS Distribution, so you need to
configure a third party repository like RPMForge or EPEL to install
Inkscape.  Installation of a third party repositories inside CentOS
Distribution is described in the following URL:
