\noindent This chapter describes the CentOS Project corporate
identity. The CentOS Project corporate identity is the ``persona'' of
the organization known as The CentOS Project.  The CentOS Project
corporate identity plays a significant role in the way the CentOS
Project, as organization, presents itself to both internal and
external stakeholders. In general terms, the CentOS Project corporate
visual identity expresses the values and ambitions of the CentOS
Project organization, its business, and its characteristics.  

The CentOS Project corporate identity provides visibility,
recognizability, reputation, structure and identification to the
CentOS Project organization by means of corporate design, corporate
communication, and corporate behaviour.
