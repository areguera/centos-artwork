To comply with upstream redistribution policy, the CentOS Project
removes all upstream brands and artworks from CentOS Distribution. The
CentOS Project has its own brand and its own artwork. The CentOS Brand
and CentOS Artwork are what the CentOS Project uses in CentOS
Distribution. 

The action of removing upstream brands and artworks and add CentOS
brands and artworks is what we call rebranding.

CentOS Brands and artworks are organized inside CentOS Artwork
Repository.  The CentOS Artwork Repository is maintain by CentOS
Artwork SIG which is formed by CentOS Community People.
