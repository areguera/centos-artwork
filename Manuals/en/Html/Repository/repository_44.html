<a name="SEC235"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.41.1 Goals </h3>

<p>This section exists to organize files related to <code>path</code>
functiontionality of <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script.  The <code>path</code>
functionality of <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script standardizes movement,
syncronization, branching, tagging, and general file maintainance
inside the repository. 
</p>

<a name="SEC236"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.41.2 Description </h3>

<p><em>&quot;CentOS like trees, has roots, trunk, branches, leaves and
flowers.  Day by day they work together in freedom, ruled by the laws
of nature and open standards, to show the beauty of its
existence.&quot;</em>
</p>

<a name="SEC237"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.41.2.1 Repository layout </h4>

<p>The repository layout describes organization of files and directories
inside the repository. The repository layout provides the standard
backend required for automation scripts to work correctly. If such
layout changes unexpectedly, automation scripts may confuse themselves
and stop doing what we expect from them to do.
</p>
<p>As convenction, inside CentOS Artwork Repository, we organize files
and directories, related to CentOS corporate visual identity, under
three top level directories named <tt>`trunk/'</tt>, <tt>`branches/'</tt>, and
<tt>`tags/'</tt>. 
</p>
<div class="float"><a name="trunk_002fIdentity_002fModels_002fImg_002fScripts_002fBash_002fFunctions_002fPaths_002ffigure_002d6"></a>
<p><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Models/Img/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path/figure-6.png" alt="trunk/Identity/Models/Img/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path/figure-6">

</p></div><p><strong>Figure 3.10: The CentOS Artwork Repository layout.
</strong>
</p>
<p>The <tt>`trunk/'</tt> directory (see section <a href="repository_3.html#SEC3">trunk</a>) organizes the main
development line of CentOS corporate visual identity. Inside
<tt>`trunk/'</tt> directory structure, the CentOS corporate visual
identity concepts are implemented using directories.  There is one
directory level for each relevant concept inside the repository. The
<tt>`trunk/'</tt> directory structure is mainly used to develop CentOS
corporate visual identity.
</p>
<p>The <tt>`branches/'</tt> directory (see section <a href="repository_1.html#SEC1">branches</a>) oranizes parallel
development lines to <tt>`trunk/'</tt> directory. The <tt>`branches/'</tt>
directory is used to set points in time where develpment lines are
devided one from another taking separte and idependent lives that
share a common past from the point they were devided on. The
<tt>`branches/'</tt> directory is mainly used to perform quality assurance
on CentOS corporate visual identity.
</p>
<p>The <tt>`tags/'</tt> directory (see section <a href="repository_2.html#SEC2">tags</a>) organizes parallel frozen
lines to <tt>`branches/'</tt> directory.  The parallel frozen lines are
immutable, nothing change inside them once they has been created.  The
<tt>`tags/'</tt> directory is mainly used to publish final releases of
CentOS corporate visual identity.
</p>
<p>The CentOS Artwork Repository layout is firmly grounded on a
Subversion base.  Subversion (<a class="www" href="http://subversion.tigris.org">http://subversion.tigris.org</a>) is a
version control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files
and directories (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and
why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  Subversion keeps a
single copy of the master sources.  This copy  is called the source
&quot;repository&quot;; it contains all the information to permit extracting
previous versions of those files at any time.
</p>

<a name="SEC238"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.41.2.2 Repository name convenctions </h4>

<p>Repository name convenctions help us to maintain consistency of names
inside the repository.
</p>
<p>Repository name convenctions are applied to files and directories
inside the repository layout. As convenction, inside the repository
layout, file names are all written in lowercase
(<samp>`01-welcome.png'</samp>, <samp>`splash.png'</samp>, <samp>`anaconda_header.png'</samp>,
etc.) and directory names are all written capitalized (e.g.,
<samp>`Identity'</samp>, <samp>`Themes'</samp>, <samp>`Motifs'</samp>, <samp>`TreeFlower'</samp>,
etc.).
</p>
<p>Repository name convenctions are implemented inside the
<code>cli_getRepoName</code> function of <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script. With
<code>cli_getRepoName</code> function we reduce the amount of commands and
convenctions you need to remember concentrating them in just one
single place you can look for fixes and improvements.
</p>

<a name="SEC239"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.41.2.3 Repository work flow </h4>

<p>Repository work flow describes the steps and time intervals used to
produce CentOS corporate visual identity inside CentOS Artwork
Repository.  
</p>
<p>To illustrate repository work flow let's consider themes' development
cycle. 
</p>
<p>Initially, we start working themes on their trunk development line
(e.g., <tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/'</tt>), here we
design background images and propagate them to different visual
manifestations using one theme's model as reference.
</p>
<p>Later, when the theme is considered &quot;ready&quot; for implementation (i.e.
all visual manifestations have been already set), we create a branch
for it (e.g., <tt>`branches/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/1/'</tt>).
Once the branch has been created, we forget that branch and continue
working the trunk development line while others (e.g., an artwork
quality assurance team) test the new branch for tunning it up. 
</p>
<p>Once the branch has been tunned up, and considered &quot;ready&quot; for
release, it is freezed under <tt>`tags/'</tt> directory (e.g.,
<tt>`tags/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFower/1.0/'</tt>) for packagers,
webmasters, promoters, and anyone who needs images from that CentOS
theme the tag was created for.
</p>
<p>Both branches and tags, inside CentOS Artwork Repository, use
numerical values to identify themselves under the same location.
Branches start at one (i.e., <samp>`1'</samp>) and increment one unit for each
branch created from the same trunk development line.  Tags start at
zero (i.e., <samp>`0'</samp>) and increment one unit for each tag created from
the same branch development line.
</p>
<div class="float"><a name="trunk_002fIdentity_002fModels_002fImg_002fScripts_002fBash_002fFunctions_002fPaths_002ffigure_002d1"></a>
<p><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Models/Img/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path/figure-1.png" alt="trunk/Identity/Models/Img/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path/figure-1">

</p></div><p><strong>Figure 3.11: Name convention for tags and branches creation.
</strong>
</p>
<p>As proposition, it would be convenient not to freeze trunk development
lines using tags or anything else.  If you think you need to freeze a
trunk development line, create a branch for it and then freeze that
branch instead.  
</p>
<p>The trunk development line may introduce problems we cannot see
immediatly. Certainly, the high changable nature of trunk development
line complicates finding and fixing such problems. On the other hand,
the branched development lines provides a less changable area where
only small fixes/corrections are commited up to repository. 
</p>
<p>If others find and fix bugs inside the branched development line, we
could merge such changes/experiences back to trunk development line
(not visversa) in order for future branches, created from trunk, to
benefit.
</p>
<p>Time intervals used to create branches and tags may vary, just as
different needs may arrive. For example, consider the release schema
of CentOS distribution: one major release every 2 years, security
updates every 6 months, support for 7 years long. Each time a CentOS
distribution is released, specially if it is a major release, there is
a theme need in order to cover CentOS distribution artwork
requirements. At this point, is where CentOS Artwork Repository comes
up to scene. 
</p>
<p>Before releasing a new major release of CentOS distribution you can
create a branch for one of several theme development lines available
inside the CentOS Artwork Repository, perform quality assurance on it,
and later, freeze that branch using tags. Once a the theme branch has
been frozen (under <tt>`tags/'</tt> directory), CentOS Packagers (the
persons who build CentOS distribution) can use that frozen branch as
source location to fulfill CentOS distribution artwork needs.
</p>

<a name="SEC240"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.41.2.4 Parallel directories </h4>

<p>Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, parallel directories are simple
directory entries built from a common parent directory and placed in a
location different to that, the common parent directory is placed on.
Parallel directories are useful to create branches, tags,
translations, documentation, pre-rendering configuration script, and
similar directory structures.
</p>
<p>Parallel directories take their structure from one unique parent
directory. Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, this unique parent
directory is under <tt>`trunk/Identity'</tt> location.  The
<tt>`trunk/Identity'</tt> location must be considered the reference for
whatever information you plan to create inside the repository.
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, parallel directories may be created removing
uncommon information from their paths. Uncommon path information
refers to those directory levels in the path which are not common for
other parallel directories.  For example, when rendering
<tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro'</tt> directory
structure, the <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script removes the
<tt>`Motifs/TreeFlower/'</tt> directory levels from path, in order to
build the parallel directory used to retrived translations, and
pre-rendering configuration scripts required by <code>render</code>
functionality.
</p>
<p>Another example where parallel directory removes the uncommon path
information is when we use the <code>help</code> functionality. This time,
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script uses parallel directory information
(without uncommon directory levels) to build the documentation entry
required by Texinfo to store documentation entries inside the
repository.
</p>
<div class="float"><a name="trunk_002fIdentity_002fModels_002fImg_002fScripts_002fBash_002fFunctions_002fPaths_002ffigure_002d3"></a>
<p><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Models/Img/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path/figure-3.png" alt="trunk/Identity/Models/Img/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path/figure-3">

</p></div><p><strong>Figure 3.12: Parallel directories removing uncommon information.
</strong>
</p>
<p>Othertimes, parallel directories may add uncommon information to their
paths. This is the case we use to create branches and tags. When we
create branches and tags, a numerical identifier is added to parallel
directory structure path. The place where the numerical identifier is
set on is relevant to corporate visual identity structure and should
be carefully considered where it will be.
</p>
<div class="float"><a name="trunk_002fIdentity_002fModels_002fImg_002fScripts_002fBash_002fFunctions_002fPaths_002ffigure_002d4"></a>

</p></div><p><strong>Figure 3.13: Parallel directories adding uncommon information.
</strong>
</p>
<p>When one parent directory changes, all their related parallel
directories need to be changed too. This is required in order for
parallel directories to match the new parent directory structure.  In
the other hand, parallel directories should never be modified by no
reason but to satisfy their parent directory structure. Liberal change
of parallel directories may suppress the conceptual idea they were
initially created for.
</p>

</p>

<a name="SEC241"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.41.2.5 Syncronizing path information </h4>

<p>Creating parallel directories is very useful to keep repository
organized. But, what would happen to functionalities like <code>help</code>
(<strong>WARNING:</strong> <em>The <samp>`trunk Scripts Bash Functions Help'</samp> documentation entry no longer exists.</em>) that rely on parent
directory structures to create documentation entries (using parallel
directory structures) if one of those parent directory structures
suddenly changes after the documentation entry has been already
created for it? 
</p>
<p>Well, at this point, functionalities like <code>help</code> may confuse
themselves if path information is not updated.  Such functionalities
work with parent directory structure as reference; if a parent
directory changes, the functionalities dont't even note it because
they work with the last parent directory structure available in the
repository, no matter what it is. 
</p>
<p>In the specific case of documentation (the <code>help</code> functionality),
the problem mentioned above provokes that older parent directories,
already documented, remain inside documentation directory structures
as long as you get your hands into the documentation directory
structure (<tt>`trunk/Manuals'</tt>) and remove what must be removed to
match the new parent directory structure.
</p>
<p>There is no way for <code>help</code>, and similar functionalities that use
parent directories as reference, to know when and how directory
movements take place inside the repository. Such information is
available only when movement actions, like thoses achived by
<code>rm</code> or <code>mv</code> commands, take place inside the
repository. So, is there, at the moment of moving files, when we need
to syncronize parallel directories with their unique parent directory
structure.
</p>
<p>Syncronizing parallel directories with their respecitive parent
directory implies moving files inside the repository, i.e. we need to,
firstly, rebuild the path information for each parallel directory
inside the repository, using the current path of its parent directory
as reference, and later, use the new path information to move each old
parallel directory from its old location to its new location based on
an updated path information.
</p>
<p>As CentOS Artwork Repository is built over a version control system,
file movements inside the repository are considered repository
changes. In order for these repository changes to be versioned, we
need to, firstly, add changes related files into version control
system, and later, use commands from the version control system to
move those files already versioned.  This configuration makes possible
for everyone to know about changes details inside the repository; and
if needed, revert or update them back to a previous revision.
</p>
<p>Finally, once all file corrections have been already made, the
syncronization action takes care of updating path references inside
related files. Updating path references inside related files is
specially important for documentation files where documentation nodes
are built using repository path information as reference.
</p>

<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.41.2.6 What is the right location to store it? </h4>

<p>Occasionly, you may find that new corporate visual identity components
need to be added to the repository. If that is your case, the first
question you need to ask yourself, before start to create directories
blindly all over, is: What is the right location to store it?
</p>
<p>The CentOS Community (<a class="www" href="http://wiki.centos.org/GettingHelp">http://wiki.centos.org/GettingHelp</a>) is the
best place to find answers to your question, but going there with
hands empty is not good idea. It may give the impression you don't
really care about. Instead, consider the following suggestions to find
your own comprehension and so, make your propositions based on it.
</p>
<p>When looking the correct place to store new files, to bear in mind the
corporate visual identity structure used inside the CentOS Artwork
Repository (see section <a href="repository_4.html#SEC4">trunk/Identity</a>) would be probaly the best advice
we could offer to you, the rest is just matter of choosing appropriate
names.  To illustrate this desition process let's consider the
<tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro/'</tt> directory as
example. It is the main development line of CentOS distribution visual
manifestation, using TreeFlower's artistic motif, inside themes of
CentOS corporate visual identity. 
</p>
<p>When building parent directory structures, you may find that reaching
an acceptable location may take some time, and as it happens most of
time, when you find it, that may be not a definite solution. There are
many concepts that you need to play with, in order to find a result
that match the conceptual idea you try to implement in the new
directory location. To know which these concepts are, split the
location in words and read its documentation entry from less specific
to more specific.
</p>
<p>For example, the
<tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro/'</tt> location
evolved through several months of contant work and there is no certain
it won't change in the future, even it fixes quite well the concept we
are trying to implement.  The concepts used in
<tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Distro/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro/'</tt> location
are described in the following commands, respectively:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">centos-art help --read=turnk/
centos-art help --read=turnk/Identity/
centos-art help --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/
centos-art help --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/
centos-art help --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/
centos-art help --read=turnk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro/
</pre>
<p>Other location concepts can be found similary as we did above, just
change the location we used above by the one you are trying to know
concepts for.
