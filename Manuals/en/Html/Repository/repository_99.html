<h3 class="subsection"> 3.23.4 Concepts </h3>

<p>Inside <tt>`trunk/Translations'</tt> directory, we use &quot;translation
entries&quot; to organize artworks &quot;translation files&quot; and their
&quot;translation templates&quot;.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="IDX7"></a>
<a name="IDX8"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translation Entries</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Translation entries exists for each artwork you want to produce.
Translation entries can be empty directories, or directories
containing translation files and translation templates.  
</p>
<p>When translation entries are empty directories, the identity entry is
used as reference to create file names and directories layout for
rendered files.  In this case, the <code>centos-art</code> script takes
one design template and outputs one non-translated file for each
design template available.  This configuration is mainly used to
produce non-translatable artworks like themes' backgrounds.
</p>
<p>When translation entries contain translation files, the translation
entry implements the CentOS release schema and is used as reference to
create file names and directories layout for translated artworks. In
this case, the <code>centos-art</code> script applies one translation
file to one design template to create one translated instance which is
used to output one translated file. When the translated file is
rendered, the <code>centos-art</code> script remove the previous instance
and takes the next file in the list of translation files to repate the
whole process once again, and so on for all files in the list. This
configuration is mainly used to produce translatable artworks like
Anaconda's progress slide images.
</p>
<p>To find out correspondence between translation entries and identity
entries, you need to look the path of both translation entries and
identity entries. For example, if you are using the Modern's artisitic
motif, the identity entry for Anaconda progress artwork is:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Modern/Distro/Anaconda/Progress
</pre>
<p>and its translation entry is:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/Anaconda/Progress
</pre>
<p>Note how the <tt>`Translations/'</tt> directory prefixes <tt>`Identity/'</tt>
directory, also how static values (e.g., Identity, Themes, Distro,
etc.) in the identity's entry path remain in translation's entry path,
and how variable values like theme names (e.g., Modern) are stript out
from translation's entry path. The same convenction can be applied to
other identity entries in order to determine their translation
entries, or to other translation entries to determine their identity
entries.
</p>
<blockquote class="blue"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Icons/Img/Bluecurve/48x48/Stock/dialog-question.png" alt="info"><h3>Note</h3><p> Translation entries related to identity entries under
<tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs'</tt> do not use <tt>`Motifs/'</tt> in the
path.  We've done this because <tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Models'</tt>
structure, the other structure under <tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes'</tt>,
doesn't require translation paths so far. So in the sake of saving
characters space when building translation entries for
<tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs'</tt> structure, we organize Motifs
translation entries under <tt>`trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/'</tt>
directly. 
</p>
<p>If for some reason <tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Models'</tt> structure
requires translation entries, we need to re-oraganize the current
directory structure accordingly.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Translation entries, as described above, can be re-used by similar
identity entries. For example the following identity entries:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Modern/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Mettle/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
</pre>
<p>are all valid identity entries able to re-use translation files inside
Anaconda progress translation entry (the one shown in our example
above). This way, you can create several identity entries and maintain
just one translation entry for all of them.  Once you change the
translation files inside the common translation entry, changes inside
identity entries will take effect inside the next you render them.
</p>
<p>Trying to make things plain and simple: inside CentOS Artwork
Repository, graphic designers can concentrate their efforts in
artworks look and feel (the identity entries), and translators in
artworks translations (the translation entries).
</p>
<a name="IDX9"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translation Markers</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Translation markers are used in &quot;Theme Model Designs&quot; and
&quot;Translation Files&quot; as replacement patterns to commit content
translation.  When you are rendering content using
<code>centos-art</code> script inisde <tt>`trunk/Identity'</tt> structure,
artistic motifs and translation files are applied to model designs to
produce translated content as result. In order to have the appropriate
translation in content rendered, markers defintion in translation
files should match markers in model designs exactly.

<p><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Models/Img/en/Scripts/renderImage.png" alt="Translation Markers">

</p></div><p><strong>Figure 3.1: The image rendering flow.
</strong>
</p>
<p>Translation markers can be whatever text you want, but as convenction
we use the following to represent releases of CentOS distribution:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <samp>`=MINOR_RELEASE='</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Replace with minor release of CentOS distribution. In the schema M.N, the minor
release is represented by the N letter.
</p></dd>
<dt> <samp>`=MAJOR_RELEASE='</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Replace with major release of CentOS distribution. In the schema M.N,
the major release is represented by the M letter.
</p></dd>
<dt> <samp>`=RELEASE='</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Replace the full release of CentOS distribution. It is
<samp>`=MAJOR_RELEASE=.=MINOR_RELEASE='</samp> basically. 
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Specific translation markers convenctions are described inside
specific translation entries. Read translation entries documentation
to know more about supported translation markers.
</p>
<p>Translation markers standardization creates a common point of
reference for translators and graphic designers. To have a clean
definition of translation markers makes possible that translators and
graphic designers can work together but independently one another.
</p>
<a name="IDX10"></a>
<a name="IDX11"></a>
<a name="IDX12"></a>
<a name="IDX13"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translation Templates</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Translation temlpates are organized inside translation entries, under
<tt>`Tpl/'</tt> directory. There is just one <tt>`Tpl/'</tt> per translation
entry. The translation template directory contains common translations
files for different release-specific translation directories.  The
translation template directory may be used as base to build
non-reusable translations.
</p>
<a name="IDX14"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translation Files</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Translation files are text files with <code>sed</code>'s commands inside,
replacement commands mainly. As convenction, translation file names
end in <samp>`.sed'</samp>. Translation files are used by <code>centos-art</code>
script to produce translated artworks for specific major releases of
CentOS Distribution. There are common translation files, specific
translation, and template translation files.
</p>
<p>For example, the Firstboot artwork of CentOS distribution uses the
images <tt>`splash-small.png'</tt> and <tt>`firstboot-left.png'</tt> as based
to control its visual style. The <tt>`splash-small.png'</tt> image
contains, in its graphic design, the release number information of
CentOS distribution. So the <tt>`splash-small.png'</tt> is
release-specific. In the other hand, the <tt>`firstboot-left.png'</tt>
doesn't contain release number information. So the
<tt>`firstboot-left.png'</tt> is not release-specific.
</p>
<p>If we want to produce Firstboot artwork for different major releases
of CentOS distribution, using a monolithic visual identity, all
Firstboot images should have the same visual style and, at the same
time, the release-specific information in the release-specific images. 
</p>
<blockquote class="blue"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Icons/Img/Bluecurve/48x48/Stock/dialog-question.png" alt="info"><h3>Note</h3><p> The monolithic visual identity is implemented using
theme models (see section <a href="repository_25.html#SEC25">trunk/Identity/Themes/Models</a>) and artistic
motifs (see section <a href="repository_45.html#SEC45">trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs</a>).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Assuming that both theme models and theme motifs are ready for using,
the initial translation entry to produce Firstboot artworks would look
like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/BootUp/Firstboot/
|-- Tpl
|   `-- splash-small.sed    &lt;-- template translation file
`-- firstboot-left.sed      &lt;-- common translation file
</pre>
<p>With this translation entry, the <code>centos-art</code> command is able
to produce the image <tt>`firstboot-left.png'</tt> only. To produce
<tt>`splash-small.png'</tt> images for major releases (e.g., 3, 4, 5, and
6) of CentOS distribution we need to produce the release-specific
translation files using the <code>centos-art</code> script as following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">centos-art render --translation=/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/BootUp/Firstboot --filter='3,4,5,6'
</pre>
<p>The above command produces the following translation entiry:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/BootUp/Firstboot/
|-- 3
|   `-- splash-small.sed        &lt;-- specific translation file
|-- 4
|   `-- splash-small.sed        &lt;-- specific translation file
|-- 5
|   `-- splash-small.sed        &lt;-- specific translation file
|-- 6
|   `-- splash-small.sed        &lt;-- specific translation file
|-- Tpl
|   `-- splash-small.sed        &lt;-- template translation file
`-- firstboot-left.sed          &lt;-- common translation file
</pre>
<p>At this point <code>centos-art</code> is able to produce the Firstboot
artwork images for major releases of CentOS distribution. To add new
release-specific translation files, run the translation rendering
command with the release number you want to produce translation files
for in the <samp>`--filter='release-number''</samp> argument.
</p>
<a name="IDX15"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Template Translation Files</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Template translation files are translation files stored inside
translation template directory. Template translation files are used by
<code>centos-art</code> script to produce specific translation files
only. Template translation files may be empty or contain
<code>sed</code>'s replacement commands. If template translation files
are empty files, the final specifc translation file built from it
contains release-specific replacement commands only. For example, the
Firstboot <tt>`splash-small.sed'</tt> template translation file looks like
the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"># -------------------------------------
# $Id: splash-small.sed 5316 2010-04-04 04:42:12Z al $
# -------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>In the above template translation file there are three comments lines,
but when you render it, the <code>centos-art</code> adds the
release-specific replacement commands. In our Firstboot example, after
rendering Firstboot translation entry, the <tt>`splash-small.sed'</tt>
translation file specific to CentOS 5, looks like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"># Warning: Do not modify this file directly. This file is created
# automatically using 'centos-art' command line interface.  Any change
# you do in this file will be lost the next time you update
# translation files using 'centos-art' command line interface. If you
# want to improve the content of this translation file, improve its
# template file instead and run the 'centos-art' command line
# interface later to propagate your changes.
# -------------------------------------
# $Id: splash-small.sed 5316 2010-04-04 04:42:12Z al $
# -------------------------------------

# Release number information.
s!=RELEASE=!=MAJOR_RELEASE=.=MINOR_RELEASE=!g
s!=MINOR_RELEASE=!0!g
s!=MAJOR_RELEASE=!5!g
</pre>
<p>If template translation files are not empty, replacement commands
inside template translation files are preserved inside
release-specific translation files.  For example, consider the English
template translation file of Anaconda progress welcome slide.  The
translation template directory structure looks like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
`-- Tpl
    `-- en
        `-- 01-welcome.sed
</pre>
<p>and if we render translation files for CentOS 4 and CentOS 5 major
releases, the translation entry would look like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Distro/Anaconda/Progress/
|-- 4
|   `-- en
|       `-- 01-welcome.sed
|-- 5
|   `-- en
|       `-- 01-welcome.sed
`-- Tpl
    `-- en
        `-- 01-welcome.sed
</pre>
<blockquote class="blue"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Icons/Img/Bluecurve/48x48/Stock/dialog-question.png" alt="info"><h3>Note</h3><p> Release-specific translation directories preserve
template translation directory structure and file names.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the example above, the template translation file looks like the
following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"># ------------------------------------------------------------

</pre>
<p>In the example above, relevant lines begin with the <samp>`s'</samp> word
followed by a separation character (e.g., <samp>`/'</samp>, <samp>`!'</samp>, etc.).
These lines have the following format:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">s/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/FLAGS
</pre>
<p>The <samp>`/'</samp> characters may be uniformly replaced by any other single
character within any given <code>s</code> command.  The <samp>`/'</samp>
character (or whatever other character is used in its stead) can
appear in the REGEXP or REPLACEMENT only if it is preceded by a
<samp>`\'</samp> character.
</p>
<p>The <code>s</code> command is probably the most important in
<code>sed</code> and has a lot of different options.  Its basic concept
is simple: the <code>s</code> command attempts to match the pattern space
against the supplied REGEXP; if the match is successful, then that
portion of the pattern space which was matched is replaced with
REPLACEMENT.
</p>
<blockquote class="orange"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Icons/Img/Bluecurve/48x48/Stock/dialog-info.png" alt="Info"><h3>Tip</h3><p> For more information about how to use <code>sed</code>'s
replacement commands and flags, read <code>sed</code>'s documentation
manual using the following command:
</p><pre class="verbatim">info sed
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In the context of our translation files, the REGEXP space is where you
define translation markers and REPLACEMENT space is where you define
the translation text you want to have after artwork rendering.
Sometimes we use the FLAG component with the <samp>`g'</samp> command to apply
the replacements globally.
</p>
<blockquote class="orange"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Icons/Img/Bluecurve/48x48/Stock/dialog-info.png" alt="Info"><h3>Tip</h3><p> Use <code>sed</code>'s <samp>`g'</samp> flag when one translation
marker needs to be replaced many times in the same translation file.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Inside translation files, you can use translation markers not only in
the REGEXP space but in the REPLACEMENT space too. In order for this
configuration to work, the REPLACEMENT of translation markers need to
be define <em>after</em> its definition. For example, see in the
release-specific translation file above how the
<samp>`s!=MAJOR_RELASE=!5!g'</samp> replacement command is defined
<em>after</em> <samp>`=MAJOR_RELASE='</samp> translation marker definition in
the REPLACEMENT space of <samp>`=TITLE='</samp> translation marker replacement
command.

</dd>
<dt> <strong>Common Translation Files</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Common translation files contain common localization or no
localization at all for their related artworks.  They are in the root
directory of the translation entry. Common translation files create
common artworks for all major releases of CentOS Distribution.
</p>
<a name="IDX17"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Specific Translation Files</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specific translation files contain specific localization for their
related artworks. Specific translation files are not in the root
directory of the translation entry. Specific translation files are
inside directories which describe the type of translation they are
doing. 
</p>
<a name="IDX18"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translation Rendering</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>When rendering translations, the <code>centos-art</code> script checks
the translation entry to verify that it has a translation template
directory inside. The translation template directory (<tt>`Tpl/'</tt>)
contains common translation files used to build release-specific
translation files. If the translation template directory doesn't exist
inside the translation entry the translation rendering fails. In this
case the <code>centos-art</code> script outputs a message and quits
script execution.
</p>
<a name="IDX19"></a>
<a name="IDX20"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translation (Pre-)Rendering Configuration Scripts</strong></dt>
<dd><p>When the <code>centos-art</code> script finds a translation template
directory inside translation entry, it looks for translations
pre-rendering configuration scripts for that translation entry.
Translation pre-rendeirng configuration scripts let you extend
translation's default functionality (described below). 
</p>
<p>Translation pre-rendering configuration scripts are stored in the
<tt>`trunk/Scripts'</tt> directory structure, inside the appropriate
language implementation. If you are using <code>centos-art</code> Bash's
implementation, the translation pre-rendering scripts are store in the
<tt>`trunk/Scripts/Bash/Config'</tt> location; if you are using
<code>centos-art</code> Python's implementation, then translation
pre-rendering scripts are stored in the
<tt>`trunk/Scripts/Python/Config'</tt> location, and so on for other
implementations.
</p>
<p>Bash's translation pre-rendering configuration scripts look like the
following:

function loadConfiguration {
...
}
</pre>
<p>Translation pre-rendering scripts are function scripts loaded and
executed when rendering a translation entry. Translation pre-rendering
scripts are loaded using the translation entry being rendered as
reference. For example, suppose you are using the
<code>centos-art</code> Bash's implementation, and you are rendering
translations for CentOS brands, in this situation the translation
entry would be:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/Brands
</pre>
<p>and the entry inside the translation pre-rendering configuration
structure would be
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Scripts/Bash/Config/Identity/Brands
</pre>
<p>Once the <code>centos-art</code> Bash's implementation detects that
translation pre-rendering configuration directory exists, it looks for
the <tt>`render.conf.sh'</tt> script file. If the <tt>`render.conf.sh'</tt>
file exists, it is loaded and executed. Once the <tt>`render.conf.sh'</tt>
file has been executed the translation rendering is over and the
script execution ends.

<a name="IDX23"></a>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>Translations Rendering Default Functionality</strong></dt>
<dd><p>In contrast, if there is no <tt>`render.conf.sh'</tt> file or it isn't
written as a function script, the <code>centos-art</code> script ignores
it and passes to apply default translation process instead.
</p>
<p>The default translation process takes place using translation
templates available inside translation entry. It is simple. The
<code>centos-art</code> script takes the template structure and
duplicates it inside a release-specific translation structure using
the <samp>`release-number'</samp> value, passed in the
<samp>`--filter='release-number''</samp> argument, as reference. Inside
release-specific translation files, release number replacements are
added at the end of each file to provide release-specific translation
to release-specific translation markers inside translation files.
