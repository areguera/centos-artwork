<h2 class="section"> 3.42 trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render </h2>


<a name="SEC242"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.42.1 Goals </h3>

<p>The <code>render</code> functionality exists to automate production of files
inside the working copy. The <code>render</code> functionality is aimed to
satisfy different file types (e.g., text-based and image-based)
production needs in different information levels (e.g., different
languages, release numbers, different architectures, etc.).
</p>

<a name="SEC243"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.42.2 Description </h3>


<p>The <code>render</code> functionality relies on &quot;renderable directory
structures&quot; to produce files. Renderable directory structures can be
either &quot;identity directory structures&quot; or &quot;translation directory
structures&quot; with special directories inside. 
</p>

<a name="SEC244"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 3.42.3 Renderable identity directory structures </h3>

<p>Identity directory structures are the starting point of identity
rendition. Whenever we want to render a component of CentOS corporate
visual identity we need to point <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> to an identity
directory structure. If such identity directory structure doesn't
exist, then it is good time to create it. Each identity directory
structure represents one visual manifestation of CentOS corporate
visual identity. See section <a href="repository_4.html#SEC4">trunk/Identity</a>, for more information.
</p>
<p>The first requirement for an identity directory structure to be
considered a renderable identity directory structure is its location
inside the working copy: it should be under <tt>`trunk/Identity/'</tt> or
<tt>`branches/Identity/'</tt> directory structure.
</p>
<p>The second requirement for an identity directory structure to be
considered a renderable identity directory structure is its directory
structure: it needs to have one <tt>`Tpl/'</tt> directory to store design
templates files, one <tt>`Img/'</tt> directory to store files produced as
rendition result, one translation directory structure to store
translation files and one script directory to store pre-rendition
configuration scripts.  All these directory structures are connected
among themselves by a common component in their path that bonds them
altogether.  See section <a href="repository_44.html#SEC230">trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Path</a>, for more
information.
</p>
<p>Inside renderable identity directory structures, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt>
can render both image-based and text-based files. Specification of
whether a renderable identity directory structure produces image-based
or text-based content is a configuration action that takes place in
the pre-rendition configuration script of that renderable identity
directory structure. See section <a href="repository_46.html#SEC253">trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config</a>, for more information.
</p>
<p>Inside renderable identity directory structures, content production is
organized in different configurations. A content production
configuration is a unique combination of the components that make an
identity directory structure renderable. One content production
configuration does one thing only (e.g., to produce untranslated
images), but it can be extended (e.g., adding translation files) to
achieve different needs (e.g., to produce translated images).
</p>

<a name="SEC245"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.42.3.1 Design template without translation </h4>

<p>The design template without translation configuration is based on a
renderable identity directory structure with an empty translation
directory structure. In this configuration, one design template
produces one untranslated file. Both design templates and final
untranslated files share the same file name, but they differ one
another in the file-type itself and the file-extension used to
describe the file type.
</p>
<p>Design templates are based on <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> (Scalable Vector Graphics)
and use the extension <code>.svg</code>.  Files produced as rendition result
(i.e., the final files translated or not) may be text-based files with
arbitrary extensions, or <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> (Portable Network Graphics) files
with the extension <code>.png</code>.  Definition of whether a final file is
text-based or image-based is set in the pre-rendition configuration
script of the renderable directory structure we want to produce files
for.
</p>
<p>For example, to produce images without translations (there is no much
use in producing text-based files without translations), consider the
following configuration:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <strong>One renderable identity directory structure:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specify the identity component we want to produce images for.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Identity/DirName
|-- Tpl
|   `-- file.svg
`-- Img
    `-- file.png
</pre>
<p>Inside design template directory, design template files can be
organized using several directory levels.  Using several levels of
directories inside design template directory let us to create very
simple but extensible configurations, specially if translated images
are not required.
</p>
<blockquote class="blue"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Widgets/Img/icon-admonition-info.png" alt="info"><h3>Note</h3><p> When we use a &quot;design template without translation&quot;
configuration,  <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> creates the <tt>`Img/'</tt> directory
structure automatically taking the <tt>`Tpl/'</tt> directory structure as
reference at rendition time.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In order for <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> (Scalable Vector Graphics) files to be
considered &quot;design template&quot; files, they should be placed under the
design template directory and to have set a <code>CENTOSARTWORK</code>
object id inside.
</p>
<p>The <code>CENTOSARTWORK</code> word itself is a convenction name we use to
define which object/design area, inside a design template, the
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script will use to export as PNG image at
rendition time.  Whithout such object id specification, the
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> script cannot know what object/design area you
(as designer) want to export as PNG image file.
</p>
<p>Inside the working copy, you can find an example of &quot;design template
without translation&quot; configuration at <tt>`trunk/Identity/Models/'</tt>.
</p>
<p>See section <a href="repository_4.html#SEC4">trunk/Identity</a>, for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>One translation directory structure:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In order for an identity entry to be considered an identity renderable
directory structure, it should have a translation entry. The content
of the translation entry is relevant to determine how the identity
renderable directory entry is processed.
</p>
<p>If the translation entry is empty (i.e., there is no file inside it),
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> interprets the identity renderable directory
structure as a &quot;design templates without translation&quot; configuration.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/DirName
`-- (empty)
</pre>
<p>If the translation entry is not empty, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> can
interpret the identity renderable directory structure as any of the
following configuration: &quot;design templates with translations
(one-to-one)&quot; or &quot;design templates with translations (optimized)&quot;.
Which one of these configuration is used depends on the value assigned
to the matching list (<var>MATCHINGLIST</var>) variable.
</p>
<p>If the matching list variable is empty (as it is by default), then
&quot;design templates with translations (one-to-one)&quot; configuration is
used. In this configuration it is required that both design templates
and translation files have the same file names. 
</p>
<p>If the matching list variable is not empty (because you redefine it in
the pre-rendition configuration script), then &quot;design templates with
translations (optimized)&quot; configuration is used instead. In this
configuration, design templates and translation files don't need to
have the same names since such relation between them is specified in
the matching list properly.
</p>
<p>See section <a href="repository_53.html#SEC296">trunk/Translations</a>, for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>One pre-rendition configuration script:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to make an identity entry renderable, a pre-rendition
configuration script should exist for it.  The pre-rendition
configuration script specifies what type of rendition does
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> will perform and the way it does it.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/DirName
`-- render.conf.sh
</pre>
<p>In this configuration the pre-rendition configuration script
(<tt>`render.conf.sh'</tt>) would look like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">function render_loadConfig {

    # Define rendition actions.
    ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'

}
</pre>
<p>To produce untranslated images, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> takes one design
template and creates one temporal instance from it. Later,
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> uses the temporal design template instance as
source file to export the final untranslated image. The export action
is possible thanks to Inkscape's command-line interface and the
<code>CENTOSARTWORK</code> object id we set inside design templates.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">centos-art.sh render --identity=trunk/Identity/DirName

<p>Finally, when the untranslated image has been created, the temporal
design template instance is removed. At this point, the next design
template in the list is taken to repeat the production flow once again
and so on, until all design templates be processed.

<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.42.3.2 Design template with translation (one-to-one) </h4>

<p>Producing untranslated images is fine in many cases, but not always.
Sometimes it is required to produce images in different languages and
that is something that untrasnlated image production cannot achieve.
However, if we fill its empty translation entry with translation files
(one for each design template) we extend the production flow from
untranslated image production to translated image production.
</p>
<p>In order for <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> to produce images correctly, each
design template should have one translation file and each translation
file should have one design template.  Otherwise, if there is a
missing design template or a missing translation file,
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> will not produce the final image related to the
missing component.
</p>
<p>In order for <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> to know which is the relation
between translation files and design templates the translation
directory structure is taken as reference.  For example, the
<tt>`trunk/Translations/Identity/DirName/file.sed'</tt> translation file
does match <tt>`trunk/Identity/DirName/Tpl/file.svg'</tt> design template,
but it doesn't match <tt>`trunk/Identity/DirName/File.svg'</tt> or
<tt>`trunk/Identity/DirName/Tpl/File.svg'</tt> or
<tt>`trunk/Identity/DirName/Tpl/SubDir/file.svg'</tt> design templates.
</p>
<p>The pre-rendition configuration script used to produce untranslated
images is the same we use to produce translated images. There is no
need to modify it. So, as we are using the same pre-rendition
configuration script, we can say that translated image production is
somehow an extended/improved version of untranslated image production.
</p>
<blockquote class="blue"><img src="/home/centos/artwork/trunk/Identity/Widgets/Img/icon-admonition-info.png" alt="info"><h3>Note</h3><p> If we use no translation file in the translation entry
(i.e., an empty directory), <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> assumes the
untranslated image production. If we fill the translation entry with
translation files, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> assumes the translated image
production.  
</p></blockquote>

<p>To produce final images, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> applies one translation
file to one design template and produce a translated design template
instance. Later, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> uses the translated template
instance to produce the translated image. Finally, when the translated
image has been produced, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> removes the translated
design template instance. This production flow is repeated for each
translation file available in the translatio entry. 
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">centos-art.sh render --identity=trunk/Identity/DirName

<a name="SEC247"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.42.3.3 Design template with translation (optimized) </h4>

<p>Producing translated images satisfies almost all our production images
needs, but there is still a pitfall in them. In order to produce
translated images as in the &quot;one-to-one&quot; configuration describes
previously, it is required that one translation file has one design
template. That's useful in many cases, but what would happen if we
need to apply many different translation files to the same design
template?  Should we have to duplicate the same design template file
for each translation file, in order to satisfy the &quot;one-to-one&quot;
relation? What if we need to assign translation files to design
templates arbitrarily?
</p>
<p>Certenly, that's something the &quot;one-to-one&quot; configuration cannot
handle.  So, that's why we had to &quot;optimize&quot; it. The optimized
configuration consists on using a matching list (<var>MATCHINGLIST</var>)
variable that specifies the relationship between translation files and
design templates in an arbitrary way. Using such matching list between
translation files and design templates let us use as many assignment
combinations as translation files and design templates we are working
with.
</p>
<p>The <var>MATCHINGLIST</var> variable is set in the pre-rendition
configuration script of the component we want to produce images for.
By default, the <var>MATCHINGLIST</var> variable is empty which means no
matching list is used. Otherwise, if <var>MATCHINGLIST</var> variable has a
value different to empty value then, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> interprets
the matching list in order to know how translation files are applied
to design templates.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the following configuration:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <strong>One entry under <tt>`trunk/Identity/'</tt>:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this configuration we want to produce three images using a
paragraph-based style, controlled by <tt>`paragraph.svg'</tt> design
template; and one image using a list-based style, controlled by
<tt>`list.svg'</tt> design template.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Identity/DirName
|-- Tpl
|   |-- paragraph.svg
|   `-- list.svg
`-- Img

    `-- 04-support.png
</pre>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>One entry under <tt>`trunk/Translations/'</tt>:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to produce translated images we need to have one translation
file for each translated image we want to produce. Notice how
translation names do match final image file names, but how translation
names do not match design template names. When we use matching list
there is no need for translation files to match the names of design
templates, such name relation is set inside the matching list itself.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Translations/Identity/DirName
|-- 01-welcome.sed
|-- 02-donate.sed

`-- 04-support.sed
</pre>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>One entry under <tt>`trunk/trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/'</tt>:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to produce different translated images using specific design
templates, we need to specify the relation between translation files
and design templates in a way that <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> could know
exactly what translation file to apply to what design template. This
relation between translation files and design templates is set using
the matching list <var>MATCHINGLIST</var> variable inside the pre-rendition
configuration script of the component we want to produce images for.  
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/DirName
`-- render.conf.sh
</pre>
<p>In this configuration the pre-rendition configuration script
(<tt>`render.conf.sh'</tt>) would look like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">function render_loadConfig {

    # Define rendition actions.
    ACTIONS[0]='BASE:renderImage'

    # Define matching list.

    list.svg:\
        03-docs.sed
    &quot;

}
</pre>
<p>As result, <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> will produce <tt>`01-welcome.png'</tt>,
<tt>`02-donate.png'</tt> and <tt>`04-support.png'</tt> using the
paragraph-based design template, but <tt>`03-docs.png'</tt> using the

<a name="SEC248"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection"> 3.42.3.4 Design template with translation (optimized+flexibility) </h4>

<p>In the production models we've seen so far, there are design templates
to produce untranslated images and translation files which combiend
with design templates produce translated images. That may seems like
all our needs are covered, doesn't it? Well, it <em>almost</em> does.
</p>
<p>Generally, we use design templates to define how final images will
look like. Generally, each renderable directory structure has one
<tt>`Tpl/'</tt> directory where we organize design templates for that
identity component. So, we can say that there is only one unique
design template definition for each identity component; or what is the
same, said differently, identity components can be produced in one way
only, the way its own design template directory specifies.  This is
not enough for theme production. It is a limitation, indeed.
</p>
<p>Initially, to create one theme, we created one renderable directory
structure for each theme component. When we found ourselves with many
themes, and components inside them, it was obvious that the same
design model was duplicated inside each theme. As design models were
independently one another, if we changed one theme's design model,
that change was useless to other themes. So, in order to reuse design
model changes, we unified design models into one common directory
structure.
</p>
<p>With design models unified in a common structure, another problem rose
up. As design models also had the visual style of theme components,
there was no difference between themes, so there was no apparent need
to have an independent theme directory structure for each different
theme.  So, it was also needed to separate visual styles from design
models.
</p>
<p>At this point there are two independent worklines: one directory
structure to store design models (the final image characteristics
[i.e., dimensions, translation markers, etc.]) and one directory
structure to store visual styles (the final image visual style [i.e.,
the image look and feel]).  So, it is possible to handle both
different design models and different visual styles independtly one
another and later create combinations among them using
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt>. 
</p>
<p>For example, consider the following configuration:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <strong>One entry under <tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Models/'</tt>:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The design model entry exists to organize design model files (similar
to design templates). Both design models and design templates are very
similar; they both should have the <code>CENTOSARTWORK</code> export id
present to identify the exportation area, translation marks, etc.
However, design models do use dynamic backgrounds inclusion while
design templates don't.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">                        THEMEMODEL | | Design model component

`-- list.svg
</pre>
<p>Inisde design models, dynamic backgrounds are required in order for
different artistic motifs to reuse common design models. Firstly, in
order to create dynamic backgrounds inside design models, we import a
bitmap to cover design model's background and later, update design
model's path information to replace fixed values to dynamic values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <strong>One entry under <tt>`trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/'</tt>:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The artistic motif entry defines the visual style we want to produce
images for, only. Final images (i.e., those built from combining both
design models and artistic motif backrounds) are not stored here, but
under branches directory structure. In the artistic motif entry, we
only define those images that cannot be produced automatically by
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> (e.g., Backgrounds, Color information,
Screenshots, etc.).

<h3 class="subsection"> 3.42.4 Renderable translation directory structures </h3>

<p>Translation directory structures are auxiliar structures of renderable
identity directory structures. There is one translation directory
structure for each renderable identity directory structure.  Inside
translation directory structures we organize translation files used by
renderable identity directory structures that produce translated
images. Renderable identity directory structures that produce
untranslated images don't use translation files, but they do use a
translation directory structure, an empty translation directory
structure, to be precise.
</p>
<p>In order to aliviate production of translation file, we made
translation directory structures renderable adding a template
(<tt>`Tpl/'</tt>) directory structure to handle common content inside
translation files.  This way, we work on translation templates and
later use <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> to produce specific translation files
(based on translation templates) for different information (e.g.,
languages, release numbers, architectures, etc.).  
</p>
<p>If for some reason, translation files get far from translation
templates and translation templates become incovenient to produce such
translation files then, care should be taken to avoid replacing the
content of translation files with the content of translation templates
when <tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> is executed to produce translation files
from translation templates.
</p>
<p>Inside renderable translation directory structures,
<tt>`centos-art.sh'</tt> can produce text-based files only.
</p>

<h3 class="subsection"> 3.42.5 Copying renderable directory structures </h3>

<p>A renderable layout is formed by design models, design images,
pre-rendition configuration scripts and translations files. This way,
when we say to duplicate rendition stuff we are saying to duplicate
these four directory structures (i.e., design models, design images,
pre-rendition configuration scripts, and related translations files).
</p>
<p>When we duplicate directories, inside `trunk/Identity' directory
structure, we need to be aware of renderable layout described above
and the source location used to perform the duplication action.  The
source location is relevant to centos-art.sh script in order to
determine the required auxiliar information inside directory
structures that need to be copied too (otherwise we may end up with
orphan directory structures unable to be rendered, due the absence of
required information).
</p>
<p>In order for a renderable directory structure to be valid, the new
directory structure copied should match the following conditions:
</p>
<ol>
<li> To have a unique directory structure under
<tt>`trunk/Identity'</tt>, organized by any one of the above
organizational designs above.

</li><li> To have a unique directory structure under
<tt>`trunk/Translations'</tt> to store translation files.

</li><li> To have a unique directory structure under
<tt>`trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config'</tt> to set pre-rendition
configuration script.
</li></ol>

<p>As convenction, the <code>render_doCopy</code> function uses
<tt>`trunk/Identity'</tt> directory structure as source location.  Once
the <tt>`trunk/Identity'</tt> directory structure has been specified and
verified, the related path information is built from it and copied
automatically to the new location specified by <var>FLAG_TO</var> variable.
</p>
<p>Design templates + No translation:
</p>
<p>Command:
- centos-art render -copy=trunk/Identity/DirName -to=trunk/Identity/NewDirName
</p>
<p>Sources:
- trunk/Identity/DirName
- trunk/Translations/Identity/DirName
- trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/DirName
</p>
<p>Targets:
- trunk/Identity/NewDirName
- trunk/Translations/Identity/NewDirName
- trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/NewDirName
</p>
<p>Renderable layout 2:
</p>
<p>Command:
- centos-art render -copy=trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower \
                    -to=trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/NewDirName
</p>
<p>Sources:
- trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower
- trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes
- trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower
- trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Themes
- trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower
</p>
<p>Targets:
- trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/NewDirName
- trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes
- trunk/Translations/Identity/Themes/Motifs/NewDirName
- trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Themes
- trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/Config/Identity/Themes/Motifs/NewDirName
</p>
<p>Notice that design models are not included in source or target
locations. This is intentional. In &quot;Renderable layout 2&quot;, design
models live by their own, they just exist, they are there, available
for any artistic motif to use. By default `Themes/Models/Default'
design model directory structure is used, but other design models
directory structures (under Themes/Models/) can be created and used
changing the value of THEMEMODEL variable inside the pre-rendition
configuration script of the artistic motif source location you want to
produce.
</p>
<p>Notice how translations and pre-rendition configuration scripts may
both be equal in source and target. This is because such structures
are common to all artistic motifs (the default values to use when no
specific values are provided).
</p>
<p>- The common directory structures are not copied or deleted. We cannot
  copy a directory structure to itself.
</p>
<p>- The common directory structures represent the default value to use
  when no specific translations and/or pre-rendition configuration
  script are provided inside source location.
</p>
<p>- The specific directory structures, if present, are both copiable and
  removable. This is, when you perform a copy or delete action from
  source, that source specific auxiliar directories are transfered in
  the copy action to a new location (that specified by FLAG_TO
  variable).
</p>
<p>- When translations and/or pre-rendition configuration scripts are
  found inside the source directory structure, the centos-art.sh
  script loads common auxiliar directories first and later specific
  auxiliar directories.  This way, identity rendition of source
  locations can be customized idividually over the base of common
  default values.
</p>
<p>- The specific auxiliar directories are optional.
</p>
<p>- The common auxiliar directories should be present always. This is,
  in order to provide the information required by render functionality
  (i.e., to make it functional in the more basic level of its
  existence).
</p>
<p>Notice how the duplication process is done from `trunk/Identity' on,
not the oposite. If you try to duplicate a translation structure (or
similar auxiliar directory structures like pre-rendition configuration
scripts), the `trunk/Identity' for that translation is not created.
This limitation is impossed by the fact that many `trunk/Identity'
directory structures may reuse/share the same translation directory
structure. We cannot delete one translation (or similar) directory
structures while a related `trunk/Identity/' directory structure is
still in need of it.
</p>
<p>The `render_doCopy' functionality does duplicate directory structures
directly involved in rendition process only. Once such directories
have been duplicated, the functionality stops thereat.
