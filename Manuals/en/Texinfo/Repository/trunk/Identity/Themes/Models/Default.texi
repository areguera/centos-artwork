@subsection Goals

This location stores CentOS default theme model. The CentOS default
theme model is used in all visual manifestations of CentOS Project's
corporate visual identity (e.g., distributions, web sites, promotion,
etc.).

@subsection Description

@subsection Usage

Changing CentOS default theme is not very convenient because that
affects the ``recognition'' of CentOS Project.  Nevertheless, we are
interested on seeing your art work propositions.  Specially if your
art work is an improvement to the base idea behind CentOS default
theme (@strong{Modern}, squares and circles flowing up.).

If you are not happy with CentOS default theme, you can look inside
CentOS alternative themes and download the one you are interested in.
If you are not happy with any of the CentOS alternative themes
available, then go and design your own CentOS alternative theme as
described in @xref{trunk Identity Themes Motifs, Theme Motifs}.
