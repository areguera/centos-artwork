This section exists to orgnize TreeFlower's backgrounds.

@subsection Description

@subsubsection How to create backgrounds

Once you have defined the vectorial artistic motif design, use the
@command{centos-art.sh} script (as described in usage section below)
to produce the png version of it. With the png version of your
vectorial design do the following:

Open the png version with GIMP.

Save the png version as gimp's project inside
@file{trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/TreeFlower/Backgrounds/Xcf}
directory, using the same name of your vectorial design but with the
@samp{.xcf} extension.  

Now use GIMP to improve your design.  Here you may add one layer for
pattern, another for colors, and so on until you find yourself
confortable with your artwork. For example, in the revision 241 of
TreeFlower's backgrounds we use four layers, from bottom to top:

@strong{Background:} This is the lowest layer in the image. This layer
contains the png version of our TreeFlower's artistic motif.

@strong{Pattern:} Above background layer we have pattern. This layer
contains a stripes (48x48) pattern and opacity is reduced to 10%.

@strong{Color#1:} Above pattern layer we have one color layer. This
layer gives an orange (ffae00) touch to our design to some how kill
the artistic motif intensive white color. The opacity of this layer is
reduced to 15%.

@strong{Color#2:} Above color#1 layer we have another color layer.
This layer gives a blue (0066ff) touch to our design to find between
the orange, blue, white tones a passive tone color for the background.
The opacity of this layer is reduced to 10%.

@quotation
@strong{Note} There is no definite combination. To get the appropriate
visual design is a matter of constant testing.

Finally, use the GIMP's @samp{Save as copy ...} option to export
the final design. To export the final design use the same name of your
vectorial design plus @samp{-final-1.png} extension. The numer 1 in
the example represents the release of your final image. For example,
if your vectorial file is @samp{800x600.svg}, the first release of
your final image does look like @samp{800x600-final-1.png}, if a
second release is available then it would be
@samp{800x600-final-2.png}, and so on for other releases. This is
useful to track old work while new design improvements are made. 

You can repeat these steps to create images for other screen
resolutions.
