The @emph{Flame} artistic motif was completly built using Gimp 2.2 in
CentOS 5.5. In this section we describe the steps we followed through
its construction. This information may be useful for anyone interested
in reproducing the @emph{Flame} artistic motif, or in creating new
artistic motifs for The CentOS Project corporate visual identity
(@pxref{trunk Identity}).

@subsection Step 1: Set image size

Create an empty image and fill the Background layer with black
(@samp{000000}) color. Image dimensions depends on the final
destination you plan to use the image for. For the sake of our
construction example we used an image of 640x480 pixels and 300 pixels
per inch (ppi).

@subsection Step 2: Add patterns

Create a new layer named @samp{Paper}, place it over @samp{Background}
layer and fill it with @samp{Paper (100x100)} pattern. 

Add a mask to @samp{Paper} layer using radial gradient and blur it.
You may need to repeat this step more than once in order to achieve a
confortable black radial degradation on the right side of your design.
In our image dimension, the central point of radial degradation is at
430x296 approximately. Once you've done with black radial degradation,
reduce the @samp{Paper} layer opacity to 20%.

Duplicate @samp{Paper} layer and rename it @samp{Stripes}
---duplicating the layer helps us to be sure the layer masks will be
equal in both @samp{Paper} and @samp{Stripes} layers---.  Remove paper
pattern from @samp{Stripes} layer. Fill @samp{Stripes} layer with
@samp{Stripes (48x48)} pattern and reduce the @samp{Stripes} layer
opacity to 15%:

@subsection Step 3: Add flame motif

Create a new layer named @samp{Flame}. Set the foreground to white
color (@code{ffffff}). Use the Gimp's flame filter (@samp{Filters >
Render > Nature > Flame...}) to build the flame motif on @samp{Flame}
layer.

The flame filter can produce stunning, randomly generated fractal
patterns. This feature of Gimp give us a great oportunity to grant the
production of new artistic motifs very quickly because of its
``randomly generated'' nature. Once the artistic motif be created, it
is propagated through all visual manifestations of CentOS Project
corporate visual identity using the @file{centos-art.sh} script
(@pxref{trunk Scripts Bash}) inside the CentOS Artwork Repository.

To set the time intervals between each new visual style production, we
could reuse the CentOS distribution major release schema.  I.e., we
could produce a new visual style, every two years, based on a new
``randomly generated'' flame pattern, and publish the whole corporate
visual identity (i.e., distribution stuff, promotion stuff, websites
stuff, etc.) with the new major release of CentOS distribution all
together at once.

Producing a new visual style is not one day's task. Once we have the
artistic motif defined, we need to propagate it through all visual
manifestations of The CentOS Project corporate visual identity. When
we say that we could produce one new visual style every two years we
really mean: to work two years long in order to propagate a new visual
style to all visual manifestations of The CentOS Project corporate
visual identity.

Obviously, in order to propagate one visual style to all different
visual manifestations of The CentOS Project corporate visual identity,
we need first to know which the visual manifestations are.  To define
which visual manifestations are inside The CentOS Project corporate
visual identity, is one of the goals the CentOS Artwork Repository and
this documentation manual are both aimed to satisfy.

Once we define which the visual manifestation are, it is possible to
define how to produce them, and this way, organize the automation
process. Such automation process is one of the goals of
@file{centos-art.sh} script.

With the combination of both CentOS Artwork Repository and
@file{centos-art.sh} scripts we define work lines where translators,
programmers, and graphic designers work together to distribute and
reduce the amount of time employed to produce The CentOS Project
monolithic corporate identity.

From a monolithic corporate visual identity point of view, notice that
we are producing a new visual style for the same theme (i.e.,
@emph{Flame}). It would be another flame design but still a flame
design. This idea is very important to be aware of, because we are
somehow ``refreshing'' the theme, not changing it at all. 

This way, as we are ``refreshing'' the theme, we still keep oursleves
inside the monolithic conception we are trying to be attached to
(i.e., one unique name, and one unique visual style for all visual
manifestations).

Producing artistic motifs is a creative process that may consume long
time, specially for people without experienced knowlegde on graphic
design land. Using ``randomly generated'' conception to produce
artistic motifs could be, practically, a way for anyone to follow in
order to produce maintainable artistic motifs in few steps. 

Due to the ``randomly generated'' nature of Flame filter, you may find
that the same pattern is not always used each time you use the Flame
filter interface.

Using the same pattern design for each visual manifestation is
essential in order to maintain the visual connection among all visual
manifestations inside the same theme.  Occasionally, we may introduce
pattern variations in opacity, size, or even position but never change
the pattern design itself, nor the color information used by images
considered part of the same theme.

@quotation
@strong{Important}
When we design background images, which are considered part of the
same theme, it is essential to use the same design pattern always.
This is what makes theme images to be visually connected among
themeselves, and so, the reason we use to define the word ``theme''
as: a set of images visually connected among themeselves.
@end quotation

In order to recreate the same flame pattern every time we may need to,
the Flame filter interface provides the @samp{Save} and @samp{Open}
options. The @samp{Save} option brings up a file save dialog that
allows you to save the current Flame settings for the plug-in, so that
you can recreate them later.  The @samp{Open} option brings up a file
selector that allows you to open a previously saved Flame settings
file.

The Flame settings we used in our example are saved in the file:

@verbatim
trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Flame/Backgrounds/Xcf/800x600.xcf-flame.def
@end verbatim

@image{trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Flame/Screenshots/Construction/3,,,,jpg}

Ok. Now that we have created the flame motif, and also divagated a bit
about it, lets continue with the construction steps. 

Duplicate @samp{Flame} layer and rename it `Flame Blur'. Place `Flame
Blur' below @samp{Flame} layer. Add gussian blur filter (@samp{Filters
> Blur > Gussian Blur...}).

@verbatim
Horizontal:10.0
Vertical:10.0
@end verbatim

Duplicate @samp{Flame} layer and rename it `Flame Softglow'. Place
`Flame Softglow' above @samp{Flame} layer. Add Softglow filter
(@samp{Filters > Artisitc > Softglow...}).

@verbatim
Glow radius: 10.00
Brightness: 0.75
Sharpness: 0.85
@end verbatim

Reduce flame layers opacity using the same value. The value used to
reduce flame layers opacity may vary from one image to another,
specifically, on the place the image will be finally placed on.  For
example, images used as desktop background have the flame layers
opacity reduced to 50% in order to reduce brightness.  Otherwise, the
background image used in anaconda progress slides has flame layers
opacity reduced to 20% in order to reduce brightness even more so text
could look clean and readable over it.

@subsection Step 4: Add foreground color

Create a new layer named @samp{Color}, place it on top of all visible
layers and fill it with plain color (@code{4c005a}). Reduce
@samp{Color} layer opacity to 10%. You can use the @samp{Color} layer
to control the final color information you want to produce the image
for.

@image{trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/Flame/Screenshots/Construction/5,,,,jpg}

When setting color information, remember that the same artistic motif
needs to be reproduced in 14 and 16 colors for Grub and Syslinux
visual manifestations respectively. Using many different colors in the
artistic motif may reduce the possibility of your design to fix in all
different situations.  Likewise, using more colors in one design, and
less colors in another design will reduce the connectivity among your
designs, since color information is relevant to visual identity. 

It is up to you to find out justice and compromise among all possible
variables you may face, when you propagate your artistic motif visual
style to different visual manifestations of CentOS Project corporate
visual identity.
