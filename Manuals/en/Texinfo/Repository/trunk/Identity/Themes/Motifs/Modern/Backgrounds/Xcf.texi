@subsection Usage

In this directory is where you store Gimp's project files (e.g, .xcf).
This directory is not required by @file{centos-art} command line
interface. If you can create a beautiful background images using
scalable vector graphics only, then there is no need to use the
@file{Xcf/} directory to store Gimp's background projects. Of course,
you can merge Gimp's power with Inkscape's power to produce images
based on them.  In this last case you need the @file{Xcf/} directory.
