@subsection Usage

In this directory is where you store the project files (e.g, .xcf) of
Gimp.  This directory is not required by @file{centos-art} command
line interface. If you can create a beautiful background images using
scalable vector graphics only, then there is no need to use the
@file{Xcf/} directory to store background projects. Of course, you can
merge both Gimp and Inkscape power to produce images based on them.
In this last case you need the @file{Xcf/} directory.
