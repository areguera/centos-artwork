@subsection Goals

This section exists to organize files related to ``verify''
functionality of centos-art.sh script.  The ``verify'' functionality
of centos-art.sh script helps you to prepare the workstation you are
planning to use centos-art.sh script.

@subsection Description

The first time you download CentOS Artwork Repository you need to
configure your workstation in order to use automation scripts.  These
preliminar configurations are based mainly on auxiliar RPM packages
installation, symbolic links creations, and environment variables
definitions.

@subsubsection Packages

Installation of auxiliar RPM packages provides the software required
to manipulate files inside the repository (e.g., image files,
documentation files, translation files, script files, etc.). Most of
RPM packages centos-art.sh script uses are shipped with CentOS
distribution, and can be installed from CentOS base repository. The
only exception is @samp{inkscape}, the package we use to manipulate
SVG files.  The @samp{inkscape} package is not inside CentOS
distribution so it needs to be installed from third party
repositories.

@quotation
@strong{Note} Configuration of third party repositories inside CentOS
distribution is described in CentOS wiki, specifically in the
following URL:
@url{http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories}
@end quotation

@subsubsection Links

Creation of symbolic links help us to reuse components inside
repository working copies. For example, palettes of colors maintained
inside your repository working copy are not duplicated inside
program-specific configuration directories that uses them in your
workstation.  Instead, a symbolic link is created for each one of
them, from program-specific configuration directories to files in
repository working copy.  In this configuration, when someone commits
changes to palettes of colors up to central repository, they---the
changes commited--- will be immediatly available to your programs the
next time you update your repository working copy where such palettes
of colors are.

Creation of symbolic links help us to make automation scripts
available outside @file{trunk/} repository directory structure, but at
its same level it is in repository tree. This is useful if you need to
use ``render'' functionality under @file{branches/} repository
structure using the same automation scripts you use inside
@file{trunk/} repository directory structure. As consequence of this
configuration, automation scripts cannot be branched under
@file{branches/Scripts} directory structure.

Creation of symbolic links help us to alternate between different
implementations of @command{centos-art} command-line (e.g.,
@file{centos-art.sh}, for Bash implementation; @file{centos-art.py},
for Python implementation; @file{centos-art.pl}, for Perl
implementation; and so on for other implementations). The
@command{centos-art} command-line definition takes place inside your
personal binary (@file{~/bin/}) directory.

@subsubsection Environment variables

Definition of environment variables help us to set default values you
use along your user session. Environment variables definition takes
place inside your personal @file{~/.bash_profile} file. You can use
@file{~/.bash_profile} file to define which is your default text
editor (@var{EDITOR}), and any value you consider useful for your
day-by-day working journey.

@subsubsection Time coordination

Another convenction to consider is the time representation we use for
both repository server and repository working copies.  The time
representation in the repository server is set to Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC). It would be very convenient if you set your
workstation to use UTC too.  Otherwise it would be difficult for you
to find out when changes were committed in time exactly.

@quotation
@strong{Tip} Coordinated Univeral Time (UTC) time representation can
be configured when you install CentOS distribution, or later in your
graphical interface using the following command:
@verbatim
system-config-date
@end verbatim
@end quotation

@quotation
@strong{Note} If you set your system clock to use UTC time
representation, you will need to set the @var{TZ} environment
variable inside @file{~/.bash_profile} as follows:
@verbatim
export TZ=UTC
@end verbatim
This is required in order for your terminal to display the correct
time information of your zone, taking UTC time representation as
reference.
@end quotation

@subsection Usage

If this is the first time you run @command{centos-art} command, the
appropriate way to execute ``verify'' functionality is not using the
@command{centos-art} command directly, but the absolute path to
@command{centos-art.sh} script instead (i.e.,
@file{~/artwork/trunk/Scripts/Bash/centos-art.sh}).

@table @samp
@item centos-art verify --packages
This command verifies required packages your workstation needs in
order to run the @command{centos-art} command correctly. 

@item centos-art verify --links
This command verifies required links your workstation needs in order
to run the @command{centos-art} command correctly.

@item centos-art verify --environment
This command verifies required environment variables your workstation
needs in order to run @command{centos-art} command correctly.
