Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, CentOS visual identity has been
organized in ``frameworks'', which have been divided in two major
groups: ``translations'', and ``identity''.  These two groups of
frameworks are very similar in organization, they both have ``design
templates'' ---to define how things look like---, ``rendering script''
---to automate the way things are produced---, and ``translated
files'' ---to store the final result of things being produced---. But
their files differ in content and type.

The identity frameworks are focused on image conception (i.e.  image
designing, image rendering, etc.). The translation frameworks are
focused on translation files conception (i.e. translation path
definition, file name definitions, translation markers definition,
etc.).

Generally, one identity framework has one translation framework
associeted to it.  When you render images inside identity frameworks,
the related translation framework is used as translation source and
file name definition.
