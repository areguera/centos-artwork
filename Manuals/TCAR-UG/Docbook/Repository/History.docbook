        &TCAR; started at <ulink
        url="mailto:centos-devel@centos.org">The CentOS Developers
        Mailing List</ulink> around 2008, on a discussion about how to
        automate slide images used by Anaconda.  In such discussion,
        Ralph Angenendt rose up his hand to ask &mdash;Do you have
        something to show?&mdash;.

        To answer the question, Alain Reguera Delgado suggested a bash
        script which combined SVG and SED files in order to produce
        PNG images in different languages &mdash;in conjunction with
        the proposition of creating a Subversion repository where
        translations and image production could be distributed inside
        &TCC;&mdash;.

        Karanbirn Sighn considered the idea intresting and provided
        the infrastructure necessary to support the effort.  This way,
        &TCAS; and &TCAR; were officially created and world wide
        available.

        Once &TCAR; was available, Alain Reguera Delgado uploaded the
        bash script Anaconda slides; Ralph Angenendt documented it
        very well; and people started to download working copies of
        the repository to produce slide images in their own languages.
