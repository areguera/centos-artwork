        The CentOS Logo is the main visual manifestaion of The CentOS
        Project. The CentOS Project uses The CentOS Logo to connect
        all its visual manifestions (e.g., GNU/Linux Distributions,
        Websites, Stationery, etc.) and, this way, it provides
        recognition among other similar projects available on the
        Internet.

        Both The CentOS Logo and all the visual manifestations that
        derivate from it are available for you to study and propose
        improvement around a good citizen's will at The CentOS
        Community environment, but you are not allowed to redistribute
        them elsewhere, without the given permission of The CentOS
        Project.
