        <para>
            This page is used to test the proper operation of the
            Apache HTTP server after it has been installed. If you can
            read this page it means that the Apache HTTP server
            installed at this site is working properly.

        The fact that you are seeing this page indicates that the
        website you just visited is either experiencing problems or is
        undergoing routine maintenance.

        If you would like to let the administrators of this website
        know that you've seen this page instead of the page you
        expected, you should send them e-mail. In general, mail sent
        to the name <quote>webmaster</quote> and directed to the
        website's domain should reach the appropriate person. 
    </para>
    <para>
        For example, if you experienced problems while visiting
        www.example.com, you should send e-mail to
        <quote>webmaster@example.com</quote>.

    <title>About CentOS</title>
    <para>
        The Community ENTerprise Operating System (CentOS) is an
        Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from sources
        freely provided to the public by a prominent North American
        Enterprise Linux vendor. CentOS conforms fully with the
        upstream vendors redistribution policy and aims to be 100%
        binary compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove
        upstream vendor branding and artwork.) The CentOS Project is
        the organization that builds CentOS. 
    </para>
    <para>
        For information on CentOS please visit the <ulink
        url="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS website</ulink>.
    </para>

    <note>
    <para>
        CentOS is an Operating System and it is used to power this
        website; however, the webserver is owned by the domain owner
        and not the CentOS Project. If you have issues with the
        content of this site, contact the owner of the domain, not the
        CentOS project.
    </para>
    <para>
        Unless this server is on the CentOS.org domain, the CentOS
        Project doesn't have anything to do with the content on this
        webserver or any e-mails that directed you to this site.
    </para>
    <para>
        For example, if this website is www.example.com, you would
        find the owner of the example.com domain at the following
        WHOIS server: <ulink url="http://www.internic.net/whois.html"
        />.
