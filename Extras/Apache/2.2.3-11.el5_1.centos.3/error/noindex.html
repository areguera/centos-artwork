    <h1>Apache 2 Test Page</h1>

<div id="centoslinks">

    <p>This page is used to test the proper operation of the Apache
    HTTP server after it has been installed. If you can read this page
    it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is
    working properly.</p>

    <h2>If you are a member of the general public:</h2>

    <p>The fact that you are seeing this page indicates that the
    website you just visited is either experiencing problems or is
    undergoing routine maintenance.</p>

    <p>If you would like to let the administrators of this website
    know that you've seen this page instead of the page you expected,
    you should send them e-mail. In general, mail sent to the name
    "webmaster" and directed to the website's domain should reach the
    appropriate person.</p>

    <p>For example, if you experienced problems while visiting
    www.example.com, you should send e-mail to
    "webmaster@example.com".</p>

    <h2>If you are the website administrator:</h2>

    <p>You may now add content to the directory
    <tt>/var/www/html/</tt>. Note that until you do so, people
    visiting your website will see this page and not your content. To
    prevent this page from ever being used, follow the instructions in
    the file <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf</tt>.</p>

    <p>You are free to use the images below on Apache and CentOS Linux
    powered HTTP servers.  Thanks for using Apache and CentOS!</p>

    <h2>About CentOS:</h2>

    <p><strong>The Community ENTerprise Operating System</strong>
    (CentOS) is an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from
    sources freely provided to the public by a prominent North
    American Enterprise Linux vendor.  CentOS conforms fully with the
    upstream vendors redistribution policy and aims to be 100% binary
    compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream
    vendor branding and artwork.)  The CentOS Project is the
    organization that builds CentOS.</p>

    <p>CentOS is an Operating System and it is used to power this
    website; however, the webserver is owned by the domain owner and
    not the CentOS Project.  <strong>If you have issues with the
    content of this site, contact the owner of the domain, not the
    CentOS project.</strong></p>

    <p>Unless this server is on the CentOS.org domain, the CentOS
    Project doesn't have anything to do with the content on this
    webserver or any e-mails that directed you to this site.</p>

    <p>For example, if this website is www.example.com, you would find
    the owner of the example.com domain at the following WHOIS server:
    <a
    href="http://www.internic.net/whois.html">http://www.internic.net/whois.html</a></p>

    <p>For more information on CentOS please visit the <a
