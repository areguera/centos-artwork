# As I understand, the copyright exists to make people create more.
# The copyright gives creators the legal power over their creations
# and so the freedom to distribute them under the ethical terms the
# creator considers better. 
#
# At this moment I don't feel very sure about this legal affairs, but
# need to decide what copyright information the centos-art will
# output. So, I'm taking the wiki (wiki.centos.org) copyright
# information as reference.
