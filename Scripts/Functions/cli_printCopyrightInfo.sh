# cli_printCopyrightInfo.sh -- This function standardizes the
# copyright information used by centos-art.sh script.
#
# As far as I understand, the copyright exists to make people create
# more.  The copyright gives creators the legal power over their
# creations and so the freedom to distribute them under the ethical
# terms the creator considers better.  At this moment I don't feel
# very confident about this legal affairs and their legal
# implications, but I need to decide what copyright information the
# centos-art.sh script will print out. So, in that sake, I'll assume
# the same copyright information used by The CentOS Wiki
# (http://wiki.centos.org/) as reference.
