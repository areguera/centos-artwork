    - The `trunk/Translation' directory structure is removed. The
      `trunk/Locales' directory structure is used instead to store locale
      information. 
      
    - Start using XML-based files to handle both documentation (Docbook) and
      images (SVG) translation files. Translation take place by means of
      xml2po and gettext standard procedures for translation.

    - Since the command-line point of view, unify common arguments for all
      specific functionalities (e.g, --answer-yes, --quiet, --filter, etc.)
      and leave just specific arguments for specific functions to parse. There
      is no need to duplicate common arguments definitions inside every
      specific functionality.

    - Inside centos-art.sh script, functionalities start to get
      identified and separated one from another. For example, when
      images are rendered, there is no need to load manual
      functionality. There are now common functionalities and specific
      functionalities. Common functionalities are loaded when the
      script is initiated and are available to specific
      functionalities.

    - The directory structure is optimized to implements the corporate
      identity concepts and the centos-art.sh script.  The CentOS
      Artwork Repository directory structure places the organizational
      convenctions that centos-art.sh script needs to do what we
      expect from it to do.

    - The following functionalities start to take form as part of
      centos-art.sh script:

      `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Render/render.sh'  
        
            To produce translated images using Inkscape and Sed
            replacement commands.

      `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Manual/manual.sh'  
        
            To produce documentation using Texinfo.  Almost all
            LaTeX-based documents were moved to Texinfo format and
            handled by manual functionality. 
     
      `trunk/Scripts/Bash/Functions/Locale/locale.sh'  
        
            To translate centos-art.sh command-line interface messages
            using gettext.

      `trunk/Scripts/Functions/Shell/shell.sh'    
        
            To perform massive actions inside shell scripts. For
            example, update top-commentaries massively.
    
      `trunk/Scripts/Functions/Svg/svg.sh'
        
            To perform massive actions inside SVG files.

      `trunk/Scripts/Functions/Html/html.sh'
        
            To perform massive actions inside HTML files.

      `trunk/Scripts/Functions/Path/path.sh'
        
            To automate manipulation of files, branches, and tags. 

      `trunk/Scripts/Functions/About/about.sh'
        
            To print license, authors, history, copying, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2009)

- The rendering script starts to evolve into centos-art.sh script, a
  command-line interface to manipulate the CentOS Artwork Repository.

- Corporate identity concepts taken from Wikipedia and related books
  are introduced as development reference. The main goal of
  centos-art.sh turns to: automate production of a monolithic
  corporate visual identity structure based on CentOS Mission and
  CentOS Release Schema. 

- Alain Reguera Delgado is out of Internet for an undefined amount of
  time, but continues developing CentOS Artwork Repository and its
  automation tool (i.e., the centos-art.sh script) off-line.

- Documentation begins to take form in LaTeX format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2008)

    - The CentOS Artwork Repository started at CentOS Developers
      mailing list.

    - Alain Reguera Delgado shares ideas in a thread about Anaconda
      progress slide images and the possibility of automating their
      construction.

    - Ralph Angenendt rises up his hand asking: Do you have something
      to show?

    - Alain Reguera Delgado posts a Bash script to produce slide
      images in different languages ---together with the proposition
      of creating a Subversion centralized repository where
      translations and image production could be distributed inside
      CentOS Community---.

    - Karanbirn Sighn considers the idea intresting and provides the
      infrastructure to support the effort as the CentOS Artwork SIG.

        https://projects.centos.org/svn/artwork/
        https://projects.centos.org/trac/artwork/

    - Alain Reguera Delagdo uploads the rendering script to CentOS
      Artwork Repository.

    - Ralph Angenendt documents the rendering script.

    - With the rendering script and its documentation available,
      translators start to download working copies of CentOS Artwork
      Repository to produce slide images in their own languages.
