# docbook_convertToPdfFromSgml.sh -- This function transforms DocBook
# files which have set the SGML DTD in them.  To produce PDF from
# DocBook SGML DTD, we take the DocBook XML DTD file and change its
# DTD from XML to SGML. Since XML is SGML shoudn't be any problem.
# Once the DTD has been changed from XML to SGML, we use openjade
# (through `jw' shell script) to convert the SGML-based DocBook file
# to PDF.  Customization can be achieved through DSL
# (docbook-style-dsssl-1.79-4.1) shipped in this distribution.
#
# In this configuration and using default configuration settings, I've
# presented the following problems:
#
# 1. It is not possible to produce localized PDF outputs through
# `xml2po', the default way of producing localized content inside
# `centos-art.sh' script.
#
# In this configuration and using default configuration settins, I've
# presented the following advantages:
#
# 1. The PDF output produced from SGML-based files seem to be better
# looking an less buggy than PDF output produced from XML-based
# files, visually I mean.
#
# To make the whole process transparent, a temporal directory is
# created for intermediate works and final files are moved then to
# their final location.
