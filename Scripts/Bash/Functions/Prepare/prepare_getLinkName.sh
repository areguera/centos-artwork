# prepare_getLinkName.sh -- This function standardizes link name
# construction. For the construction sake, two arguments are required,
# one to now the file's base directory, and another holding the file's
# absolute path. With this information, the base directory is removed
# from file's absolute path and the remaining path is transformed into
# a file name where each slash is converted into minus sign. 
# 
# For example, if the following information is provided:
#
# ARG1: /home/centos/artwork/Identity/Brushes
# ARG2: /home/centos/artwork/Identity/Brushes/Corporate/symbol.gbr
#
# the result will be: `corporate-symbol.gbr'.
