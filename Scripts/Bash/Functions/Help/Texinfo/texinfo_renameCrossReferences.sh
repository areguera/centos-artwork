    # Update node cross references. The node-related cross reference
    # definition, long ones specially, could require more than one
    # line to be set. By default, GNU sed does not matches newline
    # characters in the pattern space, so we need to make use of
    # `label' feature and the `N' command in order to build a pattern
    # space that includes the newline character in it. Here we use the
    # `a' letter to name the label we use, followed by N command to
    # add a newline to the pattern space, the s command to make the
    # pattern replacement using the `g' flag to make it global and
    # finally the command `b' to branch label named `a'.
    #
    # Inside the pattern space, the `\<' and `\>' are used to restrict
    # the match pattern to a word boundary. The word boundary
    # restriction applied here is required to avoid undesired
    # replacements when we replace singular words with their plurals.
    # For example, if we need to change the node `Manual' to its
    # plural (i.e., `Manuals'), and no boundary restriction is used in
    # the pattern space to do that, we might end up having nodes like
    # `Manualsssss' which probably doesn't exist. This is because this
    # sed command might be applied to the same file more than once;
    # and each time it is applied, a new `Manuals' replaces the
    # previous `Manuals' replacement to form `Manualss', `Manualsss',
    # and so on for each interaction. Using word boundaries
    # restrictions prevent such issue from happening.
    sed -r -i ":a;N;s!${PATTERN[0]}!${REPLACE[0]}!g;ba" ${MANUAL_ENTRIES}

    # Update menu cross references. Menu cross reference definitions
    # hardly appear in more than one line, so there is no need to
    # complicate the replacement command.
