#
# cli_getCopyrightInfo.sh -- This function outputs copyright
# information based on action value (ACTIONVAL) variable.
#
# The copyright information is printed to show the fact that one
# person how creates something has the creation rights over that
# something he/she created. An so, the legal power to release his/her
# creation under the ethical terms of whatever license he/she
# considers more appropriate, in order to distribute his/her creation.
#
# Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, we print copyright information in
# the following image-related components:
#
#   1. The artistic motifs, to define the visual style of themes.
#
#      The copyright information of artistic motifs is owned by the
#      person who creates the artistic motif (i.e., the artistic motif
#      author). The copyright information of artistic motifs is
#      specified in the `authors.txt' file placed inside the artistic
#      motif directory structure. The copyright information of
#      artistic motifs is printed in imagesunder
#      trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Concept directory structure
#      only.
# 
#   2. The design models, to define the characteristics of themes.
# 
#      The copyright information of design models is owned by the
#      person who creates the design model (i.e., the design model
#      author). The copyright information of design models is
#      specified in the metadata of each scalable vector graphic that
#      make a design model on its own. The copyright information of
#      design models is not printed in images.
#
#   3. The CentOS themes, to cover each visual manifestation of The
#      CentOS Project corporate visual identity.  A CentOS theme is
#      made of many different images connected among themselves by
#      mean of a uniform visual pattern (artistic motif + design
#      model).
#
#      The copyright information of CentOS themes is owned by The
#      CentOS Project. Instead of printing the copyright information
#      over all images inside one CentOS theme, the copyright
#      information of CentOS themes is printed only on images related
#      to Anaconda progress first slides.
# 
# At this point, we've defined who own the creation rights of artistic
# motifs, design models, and the CentOS themes.
#     
# Now, in order for the CentOS Community to use these components, it
# is required that each component author relases his/her creation
# under a license that grants the freedom of using, studying, changing
# and releasing improved versions of his/her creation. Also, the license
# should prevent any privatizing practice or any kind of darkness that
# put in risk the freedom of CentOS Community.
# 
# What license to use is a decision that CentOS Community has to take.
# The license adopted, by CentOS Community, specifies the ethical terms
# the CentOS Community agree to work with. It reflects the
# philosophical thinking of CentOS Community, so all creation inside
# CentOS Community should be released under such license terms, no
# matter who the person who creates something be. If some person want
# to create for CentOS, that person has to aggree with CentOS
# Community philosophical thinking (i.e. that reflected by license
# adopted to release creations). This way, that's because it is so
# important that the decision of what license to use be a collective
# decision, that everyone understand why we are using this license and
# not other.
#
# I'm not a lawyer. So, I can't give details of something I don't know
# certainly.  All I can do is using my intuition and it says to me
# that Creative Common Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License
# (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) seems to be a good
# candidate. It has been used in the wiki (http://wiki.centos.org/)
# for some time. Also, other relevant projects like The Tango Project
# are using it to release art works and similar creations.
#         
# So, in the sake of covering copyright information and license needs
# inside centos-art.sh script, all images produced by `centos-art.sh'
# script will be released using the copyright information his/her
# author (see above) and the license Creative Common
# Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License
# (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).  This could change
# in the future, after a collective discussion in the CentOS mailing
# list.
