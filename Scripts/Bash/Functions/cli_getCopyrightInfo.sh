#
# cli_getCopyrightInfo.sh -- This function outputs copyright
# information based on action value (ACTIONVAL) variable.
#
# The copyright information is printed to show the fact that one
# person how creates something has the creation rights over that
# something he/she created. An so, the legal power to release his/her
# creation under the ethical terms of whatever license he/she
# considers more appropriate, in order to distribute his/her creation.
#
# Inside CentOS Artwork Repository, we print copyright information in
# the following image-related components:
#
#   1. The artistic motifs, to define the visual style of themes.
#
#      The copyright information of artistic motifs is owned by the
#      person who creates the artistic motif (i.e., the artistic motif
#      author). The copyright information of artistic motifs is
#      specified in the `authors.txt' file placed inside the artistic
#      motif directory structure. The copyright information of
#      artistic motifs is printed in imagesunder
#      trunk/Identity/Themes/Motifs/$THEME/Concept directory structure
#      only.
# 
#   2. The design models, to define the characteristics of themes.
# 
#      The copyright information of design models is owned by the
#      person who creates the design model (i.e., the design model
#      author). The copyright information of design models is
#      specified in the metadata of each scalable vector graphic that
#      make a design model on its own. The copyright information of
#      design models is not printed in images.
#
#   3. The CentOS themes, to cover each visual manifestation of The
#      CentOS Project corporate visual identity.  A CentOS theme is
#      made of many different images connected among themselves by
#      mean of a uniform visual pattern (artistic motif + design
#      model).
#
#      The copyright information of CentOS themes is owned by The
#      CentOS Project. Instead of printing the copyright information
#      over all images inside one CentOS theme, the copyright
#      information of CentOS themes is printed only on images related
#      to Anaconda progress first slides.
#
#      The copyright information printed on Anaconda progress first
#      slides is used to print the creation rights of The CentOS
#      Project over its creation (i.e., The CentOS Distribution) not
#      The CentOS Theme itself.
# 
# At this point, we've defined who own the creation rights of image
# components. Now, it is important to remark that if we need to show
# one creation copyright, in different places, all references to the
# same cration copyright information should be the same. Cannot be any
# ambiguity among them. The best way to reach this is having just one
# unique definition, and build images using that unique copyright
# definition as reference.
#     
# Another relevant point, we need to be aware of, is that related to
# the licenses. As creators has the creation rights, they have the
# right to distribute their work as their consideration.  If creators
# release their creations under the terms of a privatizing license,
# that creation will be almost useless for The CentOS Community. So,
# in order for creations to be useful in The CentOS Community,
# creators should distribution their creations under the terms of a
# license that grants the freedom of using, studying, changing and
# releasing improved versions of them. Likewise, the license should
# prevent any privatizing practice or any kind of darkness that put in
# risk the freedom of The CentOS Community.
# 
# What license should be used to distribute images (and the components
# used to build them) is a decision for The CentOS Community to take.
# The license adopted, by The CentOS Community, specifies the ethical
# terms The CentOS Community is agree to work with. It is a reference
# we all have to agree with and follow in the sake of our community
# and ourselves freedom.  That's why license selection has to be a
# collective decision, and also be constantly in question.
#
# I'm not a lawyer. So, I can't give details of something I don't know
# certainly.  All I've done so far is using my intuition and basic
# understanding of what copyright and license is. So, if you have a
# deeper understanding and experience in such legal topics, please
# feel free to make your own revisions to ideas described here.
#         
# In the sake of covering copyright information and license needs
# inside centos-art.sh script, all images produced by `centos-art.sh'
# script will be released using the copyright information of his/her
# creator (see above) and the license Creative Common
# Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License
# (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).  
#
# The Creative Common Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License has been
# adopted in The CentOS Wiki (http://wiki.centos.org/) and seems to be
# good as well to distribute image-specific creations under CentOS
# Artwork Repository. Of course, as licenses are always questionable,
# the one we've choosed could be changed in the future after a
# collective discussion in the CentOS mailing list, in order to better
# reflect the ethical feelings of our community.
