# identity_renderCopy.sh -- This function duplicates rendition stuff.
# Rendition stuff is formed by design models, design images and
# pre-rendition configuration scripts (which includes translations
# files). This way, when we say to duplicate rendition stuff we are
# saying to duplicate these four directory structures (i.e., design
# models, design images, pre-rendition configuration scripts, and
# related translations files).
