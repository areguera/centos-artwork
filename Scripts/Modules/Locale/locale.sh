# Standardize localization tasks.  The locale command provides three
# ways of producing localization files:
#
#   1. Produce localization for one file only (when a regular file is
#   provided as argument in the command-line),
#
#   2. Produce localization files for all files in the current
#   directory you provided in the command-line (when a directory is
#   provided as argument), and
#
#   3. Produce localization files for all files in the current
#   directory recursively (when a directory is provided as argument in
#   the command-line and the --recursive option is also provided).
