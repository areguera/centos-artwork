# Standardize configuration tasks related to the repository's
# workplace.
#
# When you install The CentOS Artwork Repository most of its content
# is in source format (e.g., svgz, asciidoc, etc.). In order to
# produce final content and make the connections between the produced
# components, you need to process the source formats somewhere inside
# your workstation.  The prepare module takes the first non-option
# argument passed in the command-line as the working directory where
# you are going to process source formats in your workstation. During
# the preparation process, the prepare command creates the directory
# structure, the connection with The CentOS Artwork Repository using
# symbolic links, and images required to brand other images.
#
# prepare must be the first command you run after installing The
# CentOS Artwork Repository in your workstation.
