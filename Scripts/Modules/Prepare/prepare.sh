# Standardize configuration tasks related to repository's workplace.
#
# When you install The CentOS Artwork Repository most of its content
# is in source format. In order to produce final content and make the
# connections between the produced components, you need to process the
# source formats somewhere inside your workstation.  This module takes
# the first non-option argument passed in the command-line as the
# workplace where you are going to process source formats in your
# workstation. During the preparation process, this module creates the
# workplace directory structure, the workplace connection with The
# CentOS Artwork Repository using symbolic links, and images required
# to brand other images.
#
# This module should be the first module you run in your workstation
# after installing The CentOS Artwork Repository.
