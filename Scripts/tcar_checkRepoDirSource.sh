# Standardizes the path construction of directories inside the working
# copy, using absolute paths. This function transforms relative paths
# passed as non-option arguments to tcar.sh script command-line into
# absolute paths inside the working copy, based on whether you are
# using Subversion or Git as version control system.  Further
# verifications, (e.g., whether they really exist as directories
# inside the working copy or not) should be realized outside this
# function.
#
# Use this function whenever you want to be sure non-option arguments
# passed to tcar.sh script command-line do always point to directories
# inside the working copy.  Transforming relative paths into absolute
# paths, before processing them, is very useful when you need to
# execute the tcar.sh script as command (e.g., `tcar') anywhere on
# your workstation.
function tcar_checkRepoDirSource {

    local LOCATION=${1}

    # Remove any dot from arguments passed to tcar.sh script.
    # This way it is possible to use a single dot to reflect the
    # current location from which tcar.sh was executed. Notice
    # that using a dot as argument is optional (e.g.: when you pass no
    # argument to tcar command-line, the current location is
    # used as default location). However, it might be useful to use a
    # dot as argument when you want to include the current location in
    # a list of arguments to process. Don't forget that dot slash can
    # be used to refer locations relatively.
    LOCATION=$(echo "${LOCATION}" | sed -r "s,^\.(/([[:alnum:]_/.-]+)?)?$,$(pwd)\1,g")

    # Remove the path to repository's base directory from location in
    # order to avoid path duplications here.
    LOCATION=$(echo "${LOCATION}" | sed "s,${TCAR_BASEDIR}/,,g")

    # When we use Git as version control system, there isn't a need of
    # using the `trunk', `branches', `tags' convention we were using
    # for Subversion.  The working copy begins directly with the
    # content of our repository (e.g., Documentation, Scripts,
    # Identity and Locales).
    #
    # When we use Subversion as version control system, we follow the
    # `trunk', `branches', `tags' convention to organize files inside
    # the repository and need to redefine the source path in order to
    # build the repository absolute path from the repository top level
    # on.  As convention, when you prepare your working copy through
    # tcar.sh script, the absolute path to the `trunk/'
    # directory is used as working copy. This is, path arguments
    # provided to tcar.sh script will be interpreted from trunk/
    # directory level on. For example, the following command should
    # work correctly in both Subversion and Git repositories:
    #
    #   tcar render Documentation/Manuals/Docbook/Tcar-ug
    #
    # There isn't a need of verifying the paths built here.  This is
    # something we do later, using the tcar_checkFiles function. We
    # don't do the file verification here to avoid malformed error
    # messages when we reassign variable values using this function as
    # reference (e.g., in order to prevent error messages from being
    # stored inside variables.).
    LOCATION=${TCAR_BASEDIR}/${LOCATION}

    # Remove trailing slashes passed as argument. The single slash
    # form is used to refer the repository's root directory. The
    # single slash form passed as argument of tcar.sh script is
    # useful to execute commands over the
    # entire repository tree.
    echo "${LOCATION}" | sed -r -e 's,/+,/,g' -e 's,/+$,,g'
