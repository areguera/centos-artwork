    # expressions with find, regular expressions are evaluated against
    # the whole file path.  This way, when the regular expression is
    # specified, we need to build it in a way that matches the whole
    # path we are using. Doing so, every time we pass the `--filter'
    # option in the command-line could be a tedious task.  Instead, in
    # the sake of reducing some typing, we prepare the regular
    # expression here to match the whole path using the regular
    # expression provided by the user as pattern. Do not use locations
    # as part of regular expression so it could be possible to use
    # path expansion.  Using path expansion reduce the amount of
    # places to find out things and so the time required to finish the
    # task.
    #
    # Don't do such path expansion here. Instead, do it when you call
    # this function. Otherwise you would be prohibiting the
    # application of exact patterns.

    # expansion could be introduced to it. The best we can do is
