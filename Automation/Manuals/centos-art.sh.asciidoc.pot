msgid ""
"<emphasis role=\"strong\">centos-art.sh</emphasis> exists to "
"standardize frequent tasks inside the CentOS repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you execute the <emphasis role=\"strong\">centos-art.sh</"
"emphasis> script in a terminal, it will request the absolute path "
"where you stored your working copy of CentOS artwork repository. To "
"avoid the absolute path request every time you execute the script, "
"you can edit the <literal>~/.bash_profile</literal> file and "
"declare the absolute path to your working copy there, as value to "
"TCAR_BASEDIR variable."

msgid ""
"Once <emphasis role=\"strong\">centos-art.sh</emphasis> script "
"knows what the absolute path to your working copy is, it executes "
"the file <emphasis role=\"strong\">centos-art.conf</emphasis> to "
"load default values to configuration variables into its execution "
"environment. After configuration variables have been loaded in the "
"execution environment, the script looks for supported options in "
"the first argument. If the options passed are recognized the script "
"process them. If the options aren't recognized or no option is "
"passed at all, the <emphasis role=\"strong\">centos-art.sh</"
"emphasis> script exports common functions and executes the module "
"specified as first argument, assuming the first argument is a valid "
"module name of course. Finally, the <emphasis role=\"strong"

"From version 0.5, the <emphasis role=\"strong\">centos-art.sh</"
"emphasis> script was redesigned to introduce the idea of modules to "
"its base design. Modules are individual execution environments that "
"may nest themselves one inside another efficiently to achieve high "
"levels maintainability and extensibility. This make possible for "
"modules to divide big tasks into smaller tasks that can be easier "
"to debug, maintain and share with other modules efficiently (e.g., "
"instead of loading modules all at once, they are only loaded at "
"demand and unset once they conclude their execution)."
