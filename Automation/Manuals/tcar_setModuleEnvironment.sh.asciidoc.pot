msgid "Description"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inside the centos-art.sh script, from version 0.5 on, all "
"functionalities have been rewritten to fit a modular design. This "
"modular design is conceived with the idea of loading and executing "
"only the functions that are absolutely required for the current "
"task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inside the centos-art.sh script there are two kinds of functions, "
"which are \"global functions\" and \"module-specific functions.\" "
"The global functions are loaded in the very beginning of centos-art."
"sh script and remain in memory for you to use whenever you need it, "
"using a regular function call syntax. The module-specific "
"functions, on the other hand, are only loaded when they are needed "
"and they are removed from memory once the task they were created to "
"perform is over. To load module-specific functions inside the "
"centos-art.sh script, you use the tcar_setModuleEnvironment "
"function as described in the USAGE section, above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each time you execute the tcar_setModuleEnvironment function, you "
"are creating a new module environment. Module environments are "
"logical space where you can develop solutions for specific "
"problems. These spaces are made available by creating a module "
"directory structure inside the CentOS artwork repository, "
"specifically under the Automation/Modules/ location. Inside this "
"location, you can find the different types of modules we mentioned "
"earlier (top-module, sub-module, and sib-module), based on the "
"levels deep they are stored in the file system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module directory structure, as interpreted by "
"tcar_setModuleEnvironment has the following form:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Module's directory structure."
msgstr ""

#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"Automation/Modules/\n"
"`-- $\\{MODULE_NAME}\n"
"|-- Modules/            &lt;-- module's sub-module files.\n"
"|-- Manuals/            &lt;-- module's documentation files.\n"
"|-- Locales/            &lt;-- module's localization files.\n"
"|-- Configs/            &lt;-- module's configuration files.\n"
"`-- $\\{MODULE_NAME}.sh   &lt;-- module's initialization file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This structure, is common to all type of modules. You can nest "
"modules by creating directory structures like this, inside the "
"Modules/ directory of whatever module you want to extend its "
"functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The tcar_setModuleEnvironment function falls into the group of "
"global functions inside the centos-art.sh script. Its "
"implementation uses global array variables to store information "
"about the modules and local (non-array) variables to handle all the "
"information related to modules. Each time the "
"tcar_setModuleEnvironment function is called, it adds another entry "
"to MODULE_ array variables and uses local variables to set the "
"module's current information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case you want to see debugging information for array variables "
"in tcar_setModuleEnvironment, you need to set the "
"TCAR_FLAG_DEBUGGING environment variable to \"true\". Generally, we "
"add the —debug option to modules, and set the variable there, so "
"you can control whether to see debug information or not from the "
"module's command-line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the very beginning of tcar_setModuleEnvironment function we were "
"using just local variables and it worked fine for top-module and "
"sub-module loading, however when it was needed to load a sibling "
"module, centos-art.sh failed. The failure was produced because a "
"wrong variable assignment when tried to set the path of the next "
"module to load. There was not a clean way to \"remember\" what was "
"the base directory of the parent directory so we ended up using the "
"last loaded module base directory which made impossible to load a "
"sibling module. Using array variables to store information about "
"loaded modules fixes the issue of remembering information from "
"previous modules loaded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At this time the tcar_setModuleEnvironment function seems to work "
"as expected without any issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"-m :: The name of the module you want to load. The argument of this "
"option should be module's initialization file (without extension)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"-t:: The type of module you want to load. The argument of this "
"option should be one of the following values (only):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"top-module:: is used when you want to load first-level modules, "
"such as render, locale and tuneup."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"sub-module:: is used when you want to load next-level modules. This "
"is, modules that are one inside another."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"sib-module:: is used when you want to load siblings modules. This "
"is, modules that are located at the same level."
