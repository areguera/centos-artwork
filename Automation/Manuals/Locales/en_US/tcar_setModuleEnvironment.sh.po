"In the very beginning of <emphasis role=\"strong"

"array variables and it worked fine for top-module and sub-module "
"processing, however when it was needed to do sibling processing, it "
"didn't work as expected. The failure was produced because a wrong "
"variable assignment when tried to set the path of the next module "
"to load. There was not a clean way to “remember” what was the base "
"directory of the parent directory, so it ended up using the last "
"loaded module base directory which made impossible to load a "
"sibling module. The <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">tcar_setModuleEnvironment</emphasis> function as implemented in "
"version 0.5 of The CentOS Artwork Repository, fixes this issue "
"replacing non-array variables by array variables which can remember "
