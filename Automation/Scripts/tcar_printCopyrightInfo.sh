#   tcar_printCopyrightInfo.sh -- This function standardizes the
#   copyright information printed on content produced by centos-art.sh
#   script.
#
#   As far as I understand, the copyright exists to make people create
#   more.  The copyright gives creators the legal power over their
#   creations and so the freedom to distribute them under the ethical
#   terms the creator considers better.  At this moment I don't feel
#   very confident about this legal affairs and their legal
#   implications, but I need to decide what copyright information the
#   centos-art.sh script will print out when someone request
#   information about it.  So, in that sake, I am using The CentOS
#   Artwork SIG as copyright holder and the GNU Public License,
#   version 2 or any later, for software distribution.
