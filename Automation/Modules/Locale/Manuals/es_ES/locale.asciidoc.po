msgid ""
"The <emphasis role=\"strong\">locale</emphasis> produces "
"translations files for images, documents and automation scripts "
"based on the current locale information. In order to produce locale-"
"specific translation files, the current language information set by "
"the LANG environment variable must be different to English (`en'). "
"If the current language is English, the <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">locale</emphasis> module ends its execution with an error "
"message. When the current language is different to English, the "
"<emphasis role=\"strong\">locale</emphasis> looks for source files, "
"based on the arguments you passed through the command-line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the argument you provided is a “DIRECTORY”, the <emphasis role="
"\"strong\">locale</emphasis> module looks for configuration files "
"inside it and produces translation files based on the <emphasis "
"role=\"strong\">render-from</emphasis> and <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">locale-from</emphasis> variables set in there. On the other "
"hand, when a “FILE” is provided, it takes the file extension (i.e., "
"the characters after the last dot in the file name) and looks "
"recursively in the file's directory for all the files that have the "
"same file extension the “FILE” does, and builds the list of source "
"files that will be used to produce the translation files. In this "
"case, the translation files are stored in a “Locales” directory, at "
"the same level of the “FILE” you provided as argument to <emphasis "
"role=\"strong\">locale</emphasis> module's command-line."

"Translation files are the files we use to store translatable "
"strings. These files can be either portable objects (<literal>."
"po'), machine objects (</literal>.po') or portable object templates "
"(<literal>.pot'). Machine objects are built from portable objects. "
"Portable objects are built from portable object templates (</"
"literal>.pot'). Portable object templates are built using <emphasis "
"role=\"strong\">xgettext</emphasis> or <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">xml2po</emphasis> programs, according to the source files you "
"are retrieving translatable strings from. From these files, "
"portable objects (<literal>.po') are used by <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">render</emphasis> module to produce both localized images and "
"localized documentation while machine objects (</literal>.mo') are "
"used by <emphasis role=\"strong\">gettext</emphasis> program to "
"produce localized output messages from automation scripts."
