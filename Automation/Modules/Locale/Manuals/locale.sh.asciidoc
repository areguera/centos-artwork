locale.sh(1)
============

Name
----

locale.sh - The locale module's initialization script.

Synopsis
--------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
centos-art.sh locale ...
`-- tcar_setModuleEnvironment
    `-- locale
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------

When the first argument passed to *centos-art.sh* script is the word
*locale*, the *centos-art.sh* script initializes the *locale* module
by loading the *locale.sh* file into its execution environment. The
*locale.sh* file's main purpose is to:

1. Interpret arguments and options passed through command-line using
   the _locale_getOptions_ procedure.

2. Redefine positional parameters using ARGUMENTS local variable.  At
   this point, option arguments have been removed from TCAR_ARGUMENTS
   variable and only non-option arguments remain in it.

3. Verify the current locale information to avoid English messages
   from being localized to themselves. The English language is used as
   reference to write translatable strings inside the source files.

4. Process arguments passed to locale module, based on whether they
   are files or directories.
