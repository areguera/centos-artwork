msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you execute the <emphasis role=\"strong\">render</emphasis> "
"module, it looks for configuration files inside the “DIRECTORY” "
"specified in the command-line and processes them in the order they "
"were found. When no “DIRECTORY” is specified to <emphasis role="
"\"strong\">centos-art.sh</emphasis> script, the <emphasis role="
"\"strong\">render</emphasis> module looks for configuration files "
"inside the current directory it was executed from. If no "

"emphasis> module will end its execution with an error message."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration files are regular files with the <literal>.conf</"

"for and, in some cases, for producing section blocks in specific "
"order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The format used in configuration files use section blocks in the "
"form <literal>[section-name]</literal>. Each section block ends "
"when the next section block begins or at the end of the file. "
"Section blocks contain one or more variable definitions in the form "
"<literal>option = \"value\"</literal>. In the specific case of "
"<emphasis role=\"strong\">render</emphasis> module, the "
"<literal>section-name</literal> is an alphanumeric value and points "
"to the final file or directory you want to save the processing "

"file or directory specified as <literal>section-name</literal>. "
"Name values in the <literal>section-name</literal> don't accept "
"variables or any kind of expansion in it, but configuration values "
"do. Commentaries are introduced by using the <literal>#</literal> "
"character at the beginning of lines. Commentaries defined this way "
"are excluded from processing so you can use them freely."

"The configuration files are processed from top to bottom. This is a "
"very important aspect to consider in situations where you need to "
"grantee specific priority for content production (e.g., you have "
"several files in a configuration file and need to produce some of "

"from top to bottom, section blocks set first in the configuration "

msgid "Using Paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you provide absolute paths inside configuration files, there "
"isn't confusion about the location where the file is or should be. "
"However, it introduces rigidity to directory structures inside the "
"working copy when it is necessary to move directories from one "
"place to another inside the working copy. To eliminate this "
"mobility restrictions, relative paths can be used to create modular "
"directory structures."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you use relative paths inside configuration files, paths are "
"relative to the location where the configuration file is stored in. "
"This way it is possible to move whole directory structures without "
"touching the configuration file and still have a render-able "
"structures inside the working copy. However, relative paths get "
"limited in situations where the production process needs files "
"outside the directory where the configuration file is stored in. In "
"such cases, a combination of relative and absolute paths is the "
"solution to apply."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When we need to use absolute paths to several files in the same "
"directory (e.g., we are combining them all to produce a new image) "
"but outside the current directory the configuration file is stored "
"in, it is possible to use a list of absolute paths one beside "
"another separated by space or we can use path expansion which is "
"shorter and easier to read. Path expansion is interpreted when you "
"enclose a list of file names in curly brackets using comma as "
"separator without spaces (e.g., <literal>/some/dir/{file1,file2,"
"file3}</literal>). In order for path expansion to work correctly, "
"all the file names you put inside the curly brackets' list must "
"exist in the location specified first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using Environment Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration files let you to use environment variables inside "
"them. This might result very useful when you need to provide "
"absolute paths based on variable information (e.g., the current "

"The process implemented to reduce image colors through GIMP's "
"palettes involves too much user intervention compared with "
"ImageMagick's --colors option that reduces image colors instantly "
"without user intervention. Nevertheless, the procedure of reducing "
"color through GIMP's palettes provides more quality to final images "
"than ImageMagic's --colors option does. Also, using GIMP's palettes "
"let us create LSS images from PNG images using the same exact "
"information we used to reduce colors on PNG images. This is very "
"important in order to have the same result in both image types. "
"Because of these reasons I prefer GIMP's palettes procedure against "
"others methods like it is the case of ImageMagick's for producing "
"images with reduced number of colors."
